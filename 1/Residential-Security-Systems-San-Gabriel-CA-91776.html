The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>In particular, CCTV allows greater flexibility in the deployment of security personnel by providing the facility whereby a single observer can remotely monitor several areas from one location.

<h4>Security Monitoring Systems For Home San Gabriel 91776</h4>
<p>Motion detection: Assuming you're monitoring your home when it's empty, motion detection is one of the most desirable features in a security camera. When an alarm is triggered, trained professionals take the appropriate action: alerting your emergency contacts, dispatching Guard Response (where available) to verify intrusion alarms, and alerting the appropriate responders - e.g. police, fire dept, ambulance - if an emergency is confirmed.</p>
<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use. But this alarm company delivers more in a basic package (like smoke and carbon monoxide monitoring) than many other home security companies, which explains why you'll find higher entry-level prices.</p>

Do I really need a home security system - while most people think of home security systems as a way to protect their homes from burglaries, what many people may not realize is that these systems can also protect homes from fires as well - a must, literally, to have a home security camera system.</p>
