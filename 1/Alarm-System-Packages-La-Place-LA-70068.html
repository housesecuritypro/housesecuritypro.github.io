<p>ADT launched a DIY security system in late January with the Blue Outdoor Camera , the Blue Indoor Camera , and the Blue Doorbell Camera Each product can be used individually or as part of the Blue by ADT security system, which is scheduled to launch this summer.

<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. At Vector Security we pride ourselves on our professional installation. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating ‘Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>Video doorbells are the most popular security product owned (18.2%) with a professionally monitored home security system (16.2%) as 2nd most popular. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company. Television programs and movies sometimes portray an intruder penetrating a perimeter barrier by breaking through when a CCTV camera had momentarily rotated to another location.</p>
