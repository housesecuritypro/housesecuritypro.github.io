<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>In modern digital cameras the video image is already in a digital form - ready for processing. Remote temperature monitoring systems help you keep an eye on your property, so you can intervene as soon as issues occur. Nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensor that will trigger the camera to record video when motion is detected. The specialty of these cameras is that they capture video at 2 MP resolutions.</p>
<p>Installation of CCTV cameras helps not only to prevent crimes due to visual control but also to charge criminals using the information recorded by video camera. IP security cameras send their signals over a network, allowing greater information transfer than an analog signal sent to a digital video recorder (DVR). In fact, CCTV systems have become so affordable, most smaller mom and pop stores also have CCTV systems in them for security purposes.</p>
