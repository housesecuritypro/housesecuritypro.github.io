<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. Ella can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language queries, letting users search footage to find clips showing specific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, or even individual car makes and models. These Decoders are equipped with powerful capabilities and can manage a flexible display of IP cameras on LCD video walls. When a door or window is shut, the contact of the door or window in the frame is detected by door and window sensors.</p>
<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.
