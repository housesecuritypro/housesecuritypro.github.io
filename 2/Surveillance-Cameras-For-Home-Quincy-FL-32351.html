<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has quickly become significant security equipment for safety and monitoring purposes. A single four rack unit E-Series chassis can be configured with up to 480TB in capacity, making it 10X more dense with an improvement in rack space efficiency of up to 5X over that of other Digital Video Surveillance offerings.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given. Weather-ready wired networks let you scatter a combination of dome, turret or bullet cameras around your home-or even multiple properties-to ensure total coverage. Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>
<p>However, CMOS sensor-based CCTV cameras are overshadowing their CCD counterparts in myriads of industrial use cases. Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. video analytics Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts.</p>

With a mile-long list of device options, we think Nest Secure is one of the best smart home security systems around. To the Point: Professionally installed security systems require an installation fee, but you don't have to lift a finger.</p>
