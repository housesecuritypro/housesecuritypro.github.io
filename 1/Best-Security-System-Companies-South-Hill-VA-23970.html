<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Outdoor security cameras can present more of a challenge, especially if the home's exterior has limited power sources, if you don't have many tools or if you are concerned about affecting your home's appearance. ADT Go is an app that helps provide peace of mind and reliable ADT emergency monitoring wherever you may go. Simply hold down the SOS button during an emergency and ADT will be notified and will alert emergency responders if you're not okay.</p>
<p>The recent advancements in smart sensing and actuating devices, and relevant communication technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee, and ANT make the integration of IoT in home security a lot easier.

As with their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to view live video from your phone.</p>
<p>Most apps also allow you to do things like view live and recorded video, lock and unlock doors, change thermostat settings, and silence alarms. This allows the camera or monitor to react to various scenarios, such as taking a picture when your Nest Protect detects smoke, or telling your Philips Hue smart bulb to turn on when unexpected sounds are detected. Connect both ip and usb cameras.</p>
