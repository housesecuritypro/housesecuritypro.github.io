This compact surveillance camera provides high-quality video and snapshots, along with several other useful tools for monitoring. Activate professional monitoring with a Ring Protect Plus subscription to get a lot more for a lot less. To clarify: when this security camera is triggered by a single event, it will wake up and record for 30 seconds, which is the maximum recording time that you can select via Reolink app.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
