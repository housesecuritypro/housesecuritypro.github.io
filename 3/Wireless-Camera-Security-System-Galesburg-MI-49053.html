<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>

<p>Also, SimpliSafe has an impressive 10-second response time, which is the fastest of all the security systems we reviewed. And the recording won't mess up with your network, because they have their proprietary network to transmit the video, which means the video recording won't ”eat up” your bandwidths. Until now, going digital has meant negotiating a raft of contracts between security, storage and data center vendors and forging complex IT strategies.</p>

Vivint Smart Home, for example, offers a consumer financing option that gives customers the ability to customize a state-of-the-art smart home security package for little to no upfront cost.

Once your camera is connected, you'll almost certainly be able to access it through your smartphone or tablet. Check whose at the gate before even opening it, with premium cameras with HD displays, two-way communication, and DVR security systems.</p>

<p>However, optics (lenses and image sensors ), not video resolution, are the components that determine the image quality. If cameras are capable of viewing other cameras, personnel can check on viewing obstructions, sabotage, vandalism, or other problems. This makes monitored alarms the safest bet when it comes to security, and means that burglar alarms always prove effective, no matter what.</p>

A security company will make more money if you opt for a professionally installed system. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. So, with increased demand for Security, Video-based Surveillance has become an important area for the research.</p>
