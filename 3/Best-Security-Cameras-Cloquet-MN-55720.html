Ring Alarm Security System packs the power of whole-home security into an affordable, DIY package.

<p>Evidence like this supports the theory that burglar alarms can act as a deterrent to potential crime, and are worth the investment for this reason alone. Complement public space safety systems with innovations such as Body Worn Video technology for police and security teams.
