<p>The best in smart home security systems. The Wyze Cam V2's video is on par with that of most of the cameras on our list. Besides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. Network video servers are designed for IP CCTV cameras over WAN or LAN computer networks where each camera has its own unique IP address. Many people don't realize how easy and convenient it can be to control their alarm system from their phone.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring includes a team of specialists available around-the-clock for emergencies. Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees.</p>

A new unique feature for Neurio allows you to control and monitor distributed storage systems, potentially enhancing the return on your storage investment.
