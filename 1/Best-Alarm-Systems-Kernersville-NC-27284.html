Sonitrol Western Canada can provide CCTV video surveillance support for interior and exterior video surveillance solutions that range in size from centrally monitored, total corporate systems (fully-networked with dedicated fibre optic backbones) to PC-controlled, IP-based, stand-alone remote access verifiers.

<p>Professional monitoring includes a team of specialists available around-the-clock for emergencies. Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. From door, window and motion sensors to mobile apps and cameras, we'll build the perfect alarm system for your home. Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously.</p>
