There is a strong need for clear procedural guidelines and legislation that addresses the effectiveness, purpose, and usage of video surveillance, as well as the sharing and retention of the individuals' images recorded, and that provides for penalties and public oversight.</p>
<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. A small projector cast a ray of light on a light-sensitive cell, which in turn was connected to a power circuit.

<p>These types of camera systems allow you to stream video to your smartphone, tablet or desktop computer; and will even send you notifications if they detect motion.
