You have CCTV cameras coming with range as long as 25 to 30 metres as well. In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. The amount of digital images captured on a DVR is determined by a few factors including the frames per second recorded, the amount of cameras hooked up to the DVR device, the resolution that the DVR saves the images at, and the video compression used (e.g. MPEG4).</p>
<p>The registration must take place 24 hours before the resident leaves the house to ensure that the police can take note of the application and install the camera which would be directly monitored by the police control room. NVR can record videos from a no. of digital CCTV cameras that are transmitted over the network. Most security system companies allow you to take your system to a new home, but some will charge you to buy new equipment or reinstall new devices.</p>

<p>The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system.

<p>The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
