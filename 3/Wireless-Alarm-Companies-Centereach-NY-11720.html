<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. When there is a requirement for recording more than one cctv camera and video switcher can be used, the cameras are connected into the switcher and the switcher will automatically switch the image being fed to the monitor and the video.
