<p>ADT security systems require professional installation. Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes.

Find a provider that offers an appropriate trial period to allow time for you to test out of your equipment.</p>
<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use. But this alarm company delivers more in a basic package (like smoke and carbon monoxide monitoring) than many other home security companies, which explains why you'll find higher entry-level prices.</p>
<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
