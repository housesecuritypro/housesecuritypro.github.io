<p>As previously mentioned, CCTV DVRs have a multiplexer built in which enables the user to view multiple images on the screen at any given time by segregating the screen image. The result is the broadest security infrastructure portfolio available from any single vendor, from high-performance NVRs, to hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), to the largest shared storage and archive solutions, to analytics processing.</p>
<p>They are often connected to a recording device or IP network , and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable database , and by video analysis software (such as VIRAT and HumanID ). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected.</p>
<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Technology has come such a long way that DIY systems can offer the same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. From a homeowners' point of view, you'll need to know whether you want a basic system, or one with more technologically advanced bells and whistles, such as home automation, smart home integration, and so on. Prices, monthly monitoring costs, and lengths of contracts can vary widely among various home security systems in the marketplace.</p>
