<p>Box cameras present an obvious sign for anyone who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Furthermore, there are impressive integration features for many popular smart home devices, including Nest Thermostat, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home.

<p>Control room operators depend on the CCTV camera images - displayed either on their work-stations or large-scale on a video wall”. The vast majority of smart CCTV systems link up to your smartphone via a specific app over Wi-Fi to share live streams of the footage.

<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level. Electronics can be disturbed by means such as microwave emissions, whose pulses can incapacitate conventional alarm systems or cause an unwanted alarm.” What's more, the system's pattern recognition capability prevents false alarms triggered by everyday vibrations.</p>
<p>Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about. With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
