<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings.

Video surveillance systems (or CCTV) have evolved significantly in the last several years.

<h3>Goodbye Webcams, Hello Wireless Internet Camera in Maryland Heights MO 63043</h3>
<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again.</p>

Though unmonitored systems are often smartphone compatible, you'll be tasked with monitoring them yourself.</p>
