<p>The Government of Telangana, in order to deal with safety and security issues in the capital city of Hyderabad, the Police Department initiated various projects such as City Wide Safe City Project, Community CCTV project, and â€˜Nenu Saitham' project Through these projects, the police encourage individuals, residential and business communities to install CCTV cameras in perimeters, lobbies, common area, corridors, entrances, and exits and also cover around 50 metres of the building's premises.</p>
<p>These concerns may restrict the use of CCTV cameras in certain areas, lowering the scope of business for CCTV camera manufacturers. Honeywell, a long-time manufacturer of home security equipment typically installed by other companies, is using its years of experience to provide DIY solutions.

CCTV cameras in use at a baggage screening checkpoint, where the purpose of the camera is to deter theft of items within a passenger's bag, may need a high enough resolution to identify objects within a piece of luggage for it to be admissible as evidence in a court of law.

<p>At the same time, placing CCTV cameras within such locations not only cuts the risk of having someone physically watch over such dangerous areas, but also allow you to see the place in real-time. It is of note that some garage operators do not locate cameras in parking garages and lots due to the concern that doing so may expose the company to liability unless there is adequate staff to monitor the images.</p>

Installing CCTV cameras can not only serve as a strict deterrent and provide your employees a safer place to work, but also ensure any such reprehensible activities are caught in the act.</p>
