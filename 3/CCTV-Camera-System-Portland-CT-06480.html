<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>

You can include entry sensors, a carbon monoxide detector, time-controlled outdoor lights, a voice-controlled thermostat and more.</p>
<p>In lower Manhattan, for example, the police are planning to set up a centralized surveillance center where officers can view thousands of video cameras around the downtown - and police-operated cameras have proliferated in many other cities across America in just the past several years.
