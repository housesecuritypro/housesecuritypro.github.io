<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get fully featured, professional-grade security solutions that are easy to install and simple to use. ADT doesn't list its monitoring and equipment prices online, so you have to call in before you have any idea how much a system might cost.

Even in low light or darkness, EZVIZ cameras have sharp night vision capabilities for clear-as-day images.</p>

Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
