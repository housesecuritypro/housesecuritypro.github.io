<p>Heightened physical security concerns spanning all industries, coupled with technological advancements is driving the requirement for higher camera resolutions, more fields of view with wider dynamic range and longer storage retention periods. The Internet of Things has made it easier than ever to set up a smart home in which you can remotely control your door locks, lights, thermostats, vacuums , lawn mowers , and even pet feeders, using your smartphone and an app. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. 29.1% of Americans own a DIY home security product, such as a video doorbell, self-monitored system, or a smart lock.</p>

Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>

Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
