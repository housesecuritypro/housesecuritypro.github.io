<p>So, whether it is recognizing fire hazard at a warehouse or counting people at a retail store, identifying aggressive behavior (or theft) and spontaneously letting the security officer or monitoring staff performance in a hotel, hospital, or an educational institute, the IP-driven solutions have unlocked unprecedented opportunities by leveraging video analytics, which isn't possible using conventional analog-based devices.</p>
<p>In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. In 2015 RPA teamed up with Shawn Soeder, one of our Passive House clients, an engineer by training who has experience in information technology, to create the specifications and installation instructions for an Arduino -based Passive House IoT Climate Monitoring and Reporting System.</p>
