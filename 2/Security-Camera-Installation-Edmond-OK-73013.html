<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Environments with more stringent security requirements (for example, schools, public buildings, and airports) rely on 24×7 video streams with higher resolution, and more frames per second to better identify suspicious persons and activity. Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>

<p>The owners of buildings can be fined for generating false alarms that waste the time of emergency personnel. If you're an existing customer with ADT Pulse equipment, there's no need to cancel or upgrade your service. Infrared cameras are useful where the lighting is negligible or is absent such as during night time.

<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
<p>Motion Sensing: Some cameras will only record when they notice motion, saving lots of space and energy while only capturing footage when someone is in the room.

They'll also send an alert to your phone when someone or something is out there, record video of the event, and depending on features, let you talk to whoever is on your property, all without ever having to open your door (or even be inside your house, for that matter).</p>
