<h3>Trying to Outsmart a Home Security System in Morehead</h3>
<p>Smart locks, smart thermostats, the ability to remotely turn lights off and on, arm or disarm the system from anywhere, and remote camera access are all modern features that can be integrated into any quality home security system for even more convenience and control.

Dialler burglar alarms automatically dial your phone number, or that of nominated friends and family, when the alarm is triggered.

<p>That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
