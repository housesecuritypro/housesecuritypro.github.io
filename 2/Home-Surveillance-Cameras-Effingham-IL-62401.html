<p>Founded in 2004, Ohio AMS has been proudly serving Ohio's courts and corrections industry with high quality monitoring products and services for over a decade. Video surveillance, access control and alarms have much in common, and they often work together as an integrated system to keep intruders out of secure areas, limit access to security sensitive areas, and remotely monitor critical areas to reduce the risk of crime and security incidents. You can also check out our guide to the best home security cameras for more options.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system.

<p>We offer both landline and cellular connectivity to communicate with ADT's monitoring center. That's on top of certified monitoring centers and a competitive equipment lineup that includes intrusion protection, environmental monitoring, video surveillance and smart home automation.

<p>Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app â€˜EZVIZ' by the house owners.
