<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well.

<p>Both analog and IP cameras use CCDs, and the number of pixels across their horizontal and vertical dimensions is an important factor in determining image resolution. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all.</p>

While the basics are the same, both are installed in your circuit breaker by attaching transformers to your power lines and allow real-time monitoring of consumption and generation, there are a few major differences.</p>
<p>Since the systems compared here are all installed by the company or another professional installer, all you need to do is open the door to let them in and pay the bill. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction.
