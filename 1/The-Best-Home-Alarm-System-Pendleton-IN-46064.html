<p>HYDERABAD: Since the formation of Telangana State, CCTV cameras have become an essential part of policing. Nearly 100,000^ burglaries happen at an address that has been burgled before, new figures obtained by security company ADT and independent charity Victim Support reveal. Most of the burglar alarms today employ sirens that are wired into the home's electrical source.</p>

We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
