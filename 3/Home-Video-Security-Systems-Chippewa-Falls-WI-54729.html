<p>Eurovigil Security Solution, considered as India's most advanced electronic security system, is a part of the Eureka Forbes family. Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>

AxxonSoft's intelligent VMS software powered by Huawei's outstanding computing solutions maximizes public and business security. If something triggers your alarm, you can check your cameras to see what set it off. The cost incurred by residents installing home security systems varies with customization demanded to add extra features and services, such as two-way communication, smart video monitoring (including AI and other advanced image sensors), and cellular back-up.</p>

<p>An analogue or digital camera connected to a video server acts as a network camera, but the image size is restricted to that of the video standard of the camera. DIY security systems are often preferable for renters because they are more portable and can easily be moved into a new home. Also within the IP video surveillance market, we are interested in certain vertical market studies like: Retail, Transportation, Industrial, Logistics, and Residential.</p>
<p>Home automation features: Smart home automation features include HD video surveillance services, smoke and fire monitoring, smart door lock control, garage door control and smart lighting. In this direction, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (i.e. drones) are nowadays deployed in order to provide video surveillance versatility and functionalities that are hardly possible based on conventional fixed cameras.</p>
<p>For a common set up, where 4 cameras are shooting at 30 fps and an image resolution of 320 X 240 is being used, each camera only records when motion is on, and MPEG4 compression is used, users should be able fill up a 20 to 25 GB hard drive in about 80 hours. The resolution capability depends on how a particular CCTV camera is being used. Thanks to the rise in popularity of smart home technology, it's now easier than ever to secure your home with cameras, detectors, and sometimes even a control panel.</p>
