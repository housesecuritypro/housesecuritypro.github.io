DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need them—perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs. CCTV is different from broadcast television as all the equipment is directly connected together with cables or wireless transmitters that can not be received by standard television aerials or transmissions of the video signals are only intended to be accessible by the equipment on its dedicated closed circuit.</p>
