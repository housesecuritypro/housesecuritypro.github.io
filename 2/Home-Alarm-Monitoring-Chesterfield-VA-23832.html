As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest.

He says that changing CCTV cameras from passive into active observers could have a huge chilling effect on civil society.</p>
<p>It's a complete remote home monitoring system that allows you to control everything from your smartphone.

<p>Wireless DIY home alarms are generally less expensive than systems that require a professional technician to install, but many homeowners feel safer with a wired system. Active illumination of a scene with infrared light and special infrared detection equipment will sometimes be required for nighttime CCTV operation. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.</p>
<p>What's even better is that you no longer need a complicated setup of monitoring cameras, as most modern security systems are unobtrusive, easy to install and use, and even stylish. In a digital video recorder (DVR), videos are recorded from a surveillance camera on a hard disk. You will find such cameras in jewellery shops, banks, offices, departmental stores, traffic signals, warehouses, factories, and so on. These cameras have a wide range of applications.</p>

In both cases, though, what these firms are currently offering is just the tip of the iceberg. Growing concern about public safety is prompting wider deployment of video surveillance by government agencies, private organizations, and consumers. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%).</p>
