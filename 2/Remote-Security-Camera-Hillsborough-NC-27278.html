Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system.

The Smart Surveillance Camera monitors large areas and supports vehicle capture and ANPR.</p>
<p>Some systems are dedicated to one mission; others handle fire, intrusion, and safety alarms simultaneously. Like most modern technology, home security systems have evolved and improved over time. Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensors protect space by 'looking' for changes in infrared (heat) energy levels caused by movement of an intruder. Keep an eye on with what you care about at any time from anywhere; just like a security camera.</p>

<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. There are plenty of affordable cameras available that offer good video performance, but as with just about any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power.</p>
