<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. They do not and cannot monitor security cameras. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted.</p>
