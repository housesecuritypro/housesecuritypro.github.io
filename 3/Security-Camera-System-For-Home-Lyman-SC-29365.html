For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. Protect America offers low-cost home security with flexible monitoring options. The sensor is Stick Nest Detect, which is a versatile piece of hardware, as each one can be used to secure a window, door, or even a wall, as it detects motion, with additional sensors available for $49.</p>

Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage.

<p>Smart home automation technology is increasingly popular in security systems.

The use of sophisticated systems by police and other public security officials is particularly troubling in a democratic society.
