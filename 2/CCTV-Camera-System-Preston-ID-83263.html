<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. If you have a change of heart you can add their monitoring service. Most home security alarm installers can provide all-inclusive services that include equipment plus the installation and monitoring service.
