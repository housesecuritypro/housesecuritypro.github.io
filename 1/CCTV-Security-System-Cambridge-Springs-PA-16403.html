<h3>Attempting to Outsmart a Home Security System in Cambridge Springs</h3>
<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch.
