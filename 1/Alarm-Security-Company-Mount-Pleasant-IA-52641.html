<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips. There are three types of cameras based on lighting and resolution. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>

Someone who simply needs a single camera to issue real-time alerts whenever it detects something awry would probably be happy with a basic Amazon plan at $3 per month.</p>

This kit also includes a separate keypad, contact sensor for doors or windows, motion detector, and a Z-Wave range extender so that you have the flexibility to place the base station as far from the other sensors as necessary. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equal.</p>
