Outdoor security cameras can present more of a challenge, especially if the home's exterior has limited power sources, if you don't have many tools or if you are concerned about affecting your home's appearance. ADT Go is an app that helps provide peace of mind and reliable ADT emergency monitoring wherever you may go. Simply hold down the SOS button during an emergency and ADT will be notified and will alert emergency responders if you're not okay.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring includes a team of specialists available around-the-clock for emergencies. Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa.
