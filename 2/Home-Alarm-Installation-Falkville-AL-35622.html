<p>Introducing the new surveillance-grade 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB capacity microSD cards from Micron, with up to 3 months of reliable, smart, secure edge storage.

<p>What's even better is that you no longer need a complicated setup of monitoring cameras, as most modern security systems are unobtrusive, easy to install and use, and even stylish.

<p>According to the market analysis, the residential segment is expected to grow at a CAGR 17.8% during the forecast period, which is the highest among all other end users of CCTV cameras. Driveway alarms can also be purchased in hard-wired and wireless systems. Another aspect of consideration is the development of energy-efficient devices for long-term monitoring and portable applications.</p>
<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
