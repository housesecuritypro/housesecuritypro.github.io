<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>
<p>You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed know they're being watched, and you can choose to record video clips or pictures and save them to your smart device on a whim. The cuts show various switches for attachment to doors and windows. No, you do not always have to pay for professional installation of your affordable home security system.</p>

The three electronic parts that comprise the solid-state switch of the alarm sounder are mounted on a circuit board. Usually, the outdoor cameras have high resolution in the range of 470 to 570 TVL (television lines). Beyond this list, there are many other types of CCTV cameras, but most of those are more related to the application in which the unit will be used vs. the type of camera.</p>

<p>Although criminology research suggests most intruders flee at the first sound of an alarm, complete home security offers more than just crime prevention.
