<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. Nest's parent company is Google and they offer 100% DIY wireless equipment, except for the Guard hub which has to be placed on a flat surface by the door you use most often. There is a wide range of explosion proof digital cameras system available in the market, and you might get confused about the best purchase. But, like Vivint, ADT comes professionally installed and its monitoring centers are super reliable.</p>
<p>The Traditional tier starts at about $129 for installation and $44.99 a month for monitoring, which includes two entry sensors, one motion sensor, a siren, keypad and remote. As with just about every smart home device out there, many DIY security systems can be armed and disarmed using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Increasing concerns about public safety and security, growing adoption of IP cameras, and rising demand for wireless and spy cameras are the factors driving the growth of the video surveillance market.</p>
<p>In particular, CCTV allows greater flexibility in the deployment of security personnel by providing the facility whereby a single observer can remotely monitor several areas from one location.
