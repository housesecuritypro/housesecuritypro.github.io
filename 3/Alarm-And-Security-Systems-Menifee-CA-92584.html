<p>The best in smart home security systems. It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more widespread feature of American life. Therefore, the wireless control over smart home devices increases the consumers' likelihood of purchasing these devices.</p>
<p>The optional ADT Portable HD Touchscreen lets you take control of your ADT security and home automation devices virtually anywhere in your home.

Our IP-based video security solution allows you to build a future-proof security ecosystem. Includes video monitoring & real time alerts.
