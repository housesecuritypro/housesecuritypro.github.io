<p>This smart indoor camera by Qubo is not any ordinary security gadget it's A.I. enabled. The Mi Home Security Camera Basic sports a full HD 1080p sensor that also has a viewing angle of 130 degrees and helps you capture a wider area of your surveillance spot. Ultra Series Cameras capture ultra-high quality and high definition videos. The Frontpoint alarm panel also serves as a Z-wave smart home hub, but its ability to integrate with some top smart home brands (like Google Nest) is limited.</p>
<p>Nest's parent company is Google and they offer 100% DIY wireless equipment, except for the Guard hub which has to be placed on a flat surface by the door you use most often.
