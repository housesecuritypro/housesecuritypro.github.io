<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. Sonitrol Western Canada can provide CCTV video surveillance support for interior and exterior video surveillance solutions that range in size from centrally monitored, total corporate systems (fully-networked with dedicated fibre optic backbones) to PC-controlled, IP-based, stand-alone remote access verifiers. To view live or recorded footage from your security cameras, you must hook up your DVR or NVR to a TV or monitor.</p>
<p>Video surveillance camera vendors, who have access to extensive technical and financial resources are anticipated to gain a competitive edge over their rivals, as they have the capacity to cater to the global market requirements. Those who buy burglar alarms are investing in protection; they want their security system to reduce the risk of a crime being committed against their property.</p>

Many no monthly fee home security systems offer do-it-yourself installation. Many ISPs (internet service providers) have home security offerings that easily and seamlessly integrate into current bills and services.</p>
