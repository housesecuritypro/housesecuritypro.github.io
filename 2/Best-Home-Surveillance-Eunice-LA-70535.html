Vivint Smart Home home security systems provide a number of valuable safety benefits for property owners.</p>
<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process.

Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
