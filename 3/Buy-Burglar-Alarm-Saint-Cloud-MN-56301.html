<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera.

Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>
