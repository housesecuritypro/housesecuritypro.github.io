<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>
<p>From a webcam to monitor a home to an IP-camera network serving an international business, Ivideon can handle it.

Unlike conventional cameras that can only serve the monitoring purpose, a PIR camera, by virtue of the built-in PIR sensor, detects passive infrared radiation emitted from heat sources.</p>
