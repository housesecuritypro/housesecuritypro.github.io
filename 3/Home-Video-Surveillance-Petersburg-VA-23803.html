<p>The best in smart home security systems. It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more widespread feature of American life.

If you need help with your system, ADT offers an online knowledge base or you can call anytime for help. If you want more peace of mind that a problem at your home will be dealt with quickly, you could consider a burglar alarm with a monitoring contract - 38% of the people we spoke pay for one of these.</p>
<p>Video security provides both an additional crime deterrent and an easy way to look in on your business throughout the day. Potential customers may find ADT's pricing scheme to be disagreeable: it's hard to find clear information on costs on the company's website, and you won't have an idea of your security system's price until a technician comes to your home and draws up a proposal.</p>
