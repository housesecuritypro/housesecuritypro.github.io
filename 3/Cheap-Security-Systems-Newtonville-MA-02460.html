Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings. Slash the time spent manually looking through backlogs of video footage seeking evidence and cross-checking to build a comprehensive picture. Manage your system and smart devices, get intelligent alerts, HD video, and more — so you're always in the know.</p>
<p>Cameras equipped with CCTVs are not only easy to maintain and conspicuous in their absence from the public eye but are also much more cost-effective than many other security solutions. But the company gives you some extra perks if you stick with them, including a lifetime warranty on all equipment as long as you're subscribed to monitoring services. For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered.</p>

<p>Protect your homes and offices with security systems by Eurovigil, a brand by Eureka Forbes that has come a long way in giving its customers the most advanced technology in intruder alarms.

<p>Home security has never been as easy and effortless as it is with the ADT Control app. Also, CCTV camera technology is steadily getting better, allowing you to benefit from high-tech wireless systems which are replacing older fiber optic wiring. The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future.</p>
