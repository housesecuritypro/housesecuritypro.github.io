<p>They'll record video when the doorbell is pressed or when motion is detected, and usually offer two-way audio communication that allows you to speak with the visitor from anywhere via your phone. Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. Maybe, you could succeed, but it would be better to install CCTV security systems in your house to protect your valuable assets.</p>
<p>Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
