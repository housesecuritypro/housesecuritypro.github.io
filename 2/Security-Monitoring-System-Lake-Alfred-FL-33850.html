<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Equipped with superb imaging ability and backed by 50x zoom ratio and the patented DarkFighterX technology, as well as intelligent functions like smart tracking and false alarm filtering, Ultra Series cameras provide comprehensive assistance to customers. These are some of the few factors that are further adding to the impressive growth rate of the Indian surveillance industry, paving the way for it to nearly triple its current market size to reach $2.4 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>For that reason, security companies offer some of the best deals and sales for home security during this time. In future, the police will be installing cameras with facial recognition feature. Slinex offers a wide range of IP equipment combining the innovation in IP technology which is applied to the intercom systems. Numerous studies show homes without security systems, when compared to those with professionally monitored systems, are up to three times more likely to be burglarized because burglars are opportunistic by nature and are on the hunt for easy targets.</p>
<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service. We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it.
