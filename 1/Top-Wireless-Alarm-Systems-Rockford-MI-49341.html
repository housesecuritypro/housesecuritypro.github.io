<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>DVRs evolved from the older VCR models, while NVRs represent the next step in the evolution of video recording technology. With homes that use additional home security measures 5 times less likely to be burgled, a visible home alarm is a sound investment. The intrusion monitoring service is included in all our packages.
