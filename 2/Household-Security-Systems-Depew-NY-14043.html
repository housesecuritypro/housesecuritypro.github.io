<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Start with detailed description of your security and business requirements and a reliable technology partner that will integrate and deploy the system on your behalf and the sky is the limit. The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal. CCTV cameras also have the potential of creating unintended effects, good and bad.</p>
<p>Our remote monitoring operators then use all available resources to investigate the cause of the alarm.

<p>Suggestions include rotating personnel every two hours, limit TV monitors to fewer than 10, arrange monitors in a curved configuration in front of the viewer, control the lighting over the console to avoid glare on the monitor screens or tilt the monitors if necessary, place the monitors in an order that permits easy recognition of camera locations, provide a swivel chair that hampers the opportunity for sleeping, and assign tasks to the viewer (e.g., communications and logging).</p>
<p>And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. The Control Panel is integrated with a touchpad or touchscreen, where the alarm can be armed and disarmed. Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
