<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and use — but not quite as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. AxxonSoft is a leading developer of Video Management and Physical Security Information Management software. However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night.</p>
<p>These wall-mounted devices now come with modern touchscreens, allowing you to control your home security and automation with the simple swipe of a finger. Run the software that came with your camera to set a password for the camera, and to see the IP address your router has assigned it. Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
<p>All images and video clips recorded with a Vivint surveillance system are automatically transferred via your home's Wi-Fi network to Vivint Smart Drive cloud storage. On the other hand, the best self-installed systems like Frontpoint and SimpliSafe come directly to your door pre-programmed and ready to go. These systems may not have as many bells and whistles as their professionally installed counterparts, but they're great for smaller homes that need the basics.</p>
