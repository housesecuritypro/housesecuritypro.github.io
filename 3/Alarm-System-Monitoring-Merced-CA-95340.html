<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest.

<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.

It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular.
