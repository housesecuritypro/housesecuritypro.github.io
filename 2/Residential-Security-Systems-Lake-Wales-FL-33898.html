<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>Video doorbells offer an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get close to the door. You'll also be able to monitor the video being recorded through the app, go through previously recorded footage, and check environmental markers like temperature.
