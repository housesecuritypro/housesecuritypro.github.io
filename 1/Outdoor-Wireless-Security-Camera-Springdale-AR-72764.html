<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>
<p>That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. By using the latest technology and our years of expertise in high-speed video capture, we have built a portfolio of products designed for surveillance, physical security, and smart buildings. Many cameras also offer a software zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens).</p>
<p>If you want to keep an eye on what's happening in your home when you're not there, but you don't want to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look.

<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
<p>Evidence like this supports the theory that burglar alarms can act as a deterrent to potential crime, and are worth the investment for this reason alone. Complement public space safety systems with innovations such as Body Worn Video technology for police and security teams. You can save money with a wireless, unmonitored home security system since you don't pay a monthly monitoring fee or upfront installation cost.</p>

Priyamvadha, associate professor, Department of Criminology, University of Madras, also vouches for CCTV cameras as a crime deterrent. Amazon India features a wide variety of security cameras.</p>
