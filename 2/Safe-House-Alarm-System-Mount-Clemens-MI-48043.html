<p>Changes in ambient light are compensated since the change in quantity of light is equal with respect to both photoelectric cells thereby maintaining a direct current output which cannot be amplified or cause a false alarm. However, many DIY vendors are now offering professional monitoring services; some require a contract and some allow you to pay as you go so you're only being monitored when you need it, such as when you're away on vacation.</p>
<p>Both analog and IP cameras use CCDs, and the number of pixels across their horizontal and vertical dimensions is an important factor in determining image resolution. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all.</p>
