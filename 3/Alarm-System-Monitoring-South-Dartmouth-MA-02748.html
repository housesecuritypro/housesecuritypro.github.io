<p>Once it's installed, you'll get alerts whenever the camera's motion sensors goes off, and you can see who's at your door and talk to them through the camera mic.

<p>At the same time, placing CCTV cameras within such locations not only cuts the risk of having someone physically watch over such dangerous areas, but also allow you to see the place in real-time. It is of note that some garage operators do not locate cameras in parking garages and lots due to the concern that doing so may expose the company to liability unless there is adequate staff to monitor the images.</p>
<p>This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage.</p>
