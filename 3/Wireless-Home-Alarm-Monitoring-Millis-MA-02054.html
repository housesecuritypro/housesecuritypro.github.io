<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Fraunhofer's smart alarm system, which uses light instead of electricity and fiber optics instead of copper wires, recognizes patterns to avoid false alarms. And Finolex coaxial cables come with a solid electrolytic grade which is 99.97% pure copper which is manufactured in-house and is perfect to use for CCTV cameras.
