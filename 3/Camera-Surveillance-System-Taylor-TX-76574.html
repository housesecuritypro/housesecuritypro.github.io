<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>The optional ADT Portable HD Touchscreen lets you take control of your ADT security and home automation devices virtually anywhere in your home. The fire monitoring service is included in all our packages. Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed.

Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
