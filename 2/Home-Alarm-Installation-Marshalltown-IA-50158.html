<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>Some DVRs also allow digital broadcasting of the video signal, thus acting like a network camera. We consider this the best method used today for your alarm system monitoring. A physical attack could be accompanied by a cyber attack on the video surveillance infrastructure, as a means of compromising the ability of the latter to detect the physical security incident.</p>
<p>The Connected Home package protects your home and adds next-level convenience and comfort, giving you the option to add video inside and outside your home, manage your energy use remotely, and control access to your home, all from the Vector Security App. An important component of the video system is the analog or digital video signal transmission means from the camera to the remote site and to the monitoring and recording site.</p>

<p>It might sound strange but efficiently placing CCTV cameras around your retail space can actually help your customers by allowing you to observe their behaviors more closely. Some systems, like Vivint, let you use the app and control panel for two-way communication, turning it into an intercom system. Boards are the best place to save images and video clips.
