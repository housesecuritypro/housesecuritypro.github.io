<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. It's one thing to say it but another thing to mean it. For as many years as we've been in the business, we have yet to come across anyone else who spends as much time with their customers as we do. You don't need to have an expert knowledge of CCTV systems, just a helpful and willing support staff that's more than happy to assist you with anything you may need.</p>
<p>This has grown from the American intruder market, where end users want the control panel to not only deter intruders but to also control the whole house, for example switching appliances or the heating on. In the UK market, the security system is still currently seen purely as a means of providing a deterrent. The IR LEDs enable the cameras to capture images in complete darkness.</p>
