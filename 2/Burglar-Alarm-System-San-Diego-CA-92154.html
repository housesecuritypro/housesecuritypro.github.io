Eurovigil offers highly advanced and complete security systems, which include Video Door Phones, Intrusion Alarm Systems, Home Automation Systems, CCTV Surveillance, Access Control Systems and CMS (Central Monitoring Station). This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit.</p>
<p>Additional sensors can also be added at a fairly low cost, like a $70 smoke detector, additional motion detectors for $40 and a $120 camera that can be used indoors or outside.
