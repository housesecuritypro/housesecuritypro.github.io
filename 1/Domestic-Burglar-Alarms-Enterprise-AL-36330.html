Nest Secure comes with DIY and professional installation options, and the system is controlled through the Nest app. If you want to keep it DIY but add more home automation, Abode , Ring Alarm , or Nest Secure will work better for you.</p>
<p>False positives can be an issue with home security cameras, so the option to change the detection sensitivity, with a scale from 1 to 7, is welcome.

Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.</p>
