<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera.

Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded.
