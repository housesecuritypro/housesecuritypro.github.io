<p>Burglar alarms are devices designed to prevent residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders. GUNTUR: The Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS), a special app developed by the Andhra Pradesh Police, was introduced in Guntur in August last year to enable property owners and residents to avail themselves of the free services of the CCTV surveillance of their houses when they are away.</p>
<p>The rising incidence of theft, terrorist attacks, and other crimes has resulted in an increasing need for video surveillance systems. Some home security providers offer both DIY and professional installation, while others only provide one option.

<p>Smart home automation technology is increasingly popular in security systems. In today's market, there are three main types of security system packages available: home automation, security equipment, and environmental monitoring. The use of sophisticated systems by police and other public security officials is particularly troubling in a democratic society. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording.</p>
