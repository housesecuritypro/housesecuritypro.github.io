The Internet of Things has made it easier than ever to set up a smart home in which you can remotely control your door locks, lights, thermostats, vacuums , lawn mowers , and even pet feeders, using your smartphone and an app. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. 29.1% of Americans own a DIY home security product, such as a video doorbell, self-monitored system, or a smart lock.</p>
