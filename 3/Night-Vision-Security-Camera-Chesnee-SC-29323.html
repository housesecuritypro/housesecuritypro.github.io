<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
<p>At any rate, be sure you know what the best DIY home security systems are, and what they offer in terms of protecting your home and family. Whether you're home or away, you can check your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.

<p>CP PLUS Analog HD cameras are packed with features like digital zoom, night vision and video analytics for smart surveillance. The real-time monitoring and control using the generated data create data traffic. Professional monitoring is available for $30 per month and includes cellular backup.

<p>For a common set up, where 4 cameras are shooting at 30 fps and an image resolution of 320 X 240 is being used, each camera only records when motion is on, and MPEG4 compression is used, users should be able fill up a 20 to 25 GB hard drive in about 80 hours. The resolution capability depends on how a particular CCTV camera is being used. Thanks to the rise in popularity of smart home technology, it's now easier than ever to secure your home with cameras, detectors, and sometimes even a control panel.</p>
