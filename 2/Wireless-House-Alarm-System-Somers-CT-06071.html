<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Requires Alexa device, enrollment in Amazon Alexa app, ADT interactive services, and Internet connectivity. We are interested in market studies and forecasts about the IP video surveillance market, especially IP cameras above 1MP, defined by region, type of camera and competitor.

<p>Get notifications, set alarm modes, sync all your Ring devices to the app and monitor them from one simple dashboard. Many providers offer smart home devices and or integration features that you can purchase as part of a security system package or as a standalone product.

<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability.
