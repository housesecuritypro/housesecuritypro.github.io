<h3>5 Reasons To Install A Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Peachtree City</h3>
<p>For just $300, you can set up two cameras outside of your home and get many of the same advanced monitoring features, including motion and human detection, mobile alerts, customizable activity zones, two-way audio, and integration to your preferred smart home system. Door and window sensors typically operate using a magnetic connection. At least a 720p resolution is pretty standard for home security cameras these days, but some now offer an even better resolution than that.</p>

Since starting operation in 1986, we have provided monitoring services to more than 800,000 individual offenders.
