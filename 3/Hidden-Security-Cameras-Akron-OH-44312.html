You don't have to look far into the future to see a time when all houses come equipped with home security cameras. The magnet part of the device is screwed to a door or window, and the switch part is screwed to the door or window frame.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, most of today's home security systems offer both types of coverage. When the sense line 28 becomes more positive than the positive reference voltage indicating that significant charging of the battery is occurring, the output of comparator 42 switches from a logic low to a logic high state.
