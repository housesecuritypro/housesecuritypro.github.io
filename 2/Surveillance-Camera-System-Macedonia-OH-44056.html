<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings. Slash the time spent manually looking through backlogs of video footage seeking evidence and cross-checking to build a comprehensive picture. Manage your system and smart devices, get intelligent alerts, HD video, and more â€” so you're always in the know.</p>
<p>These wall-mounted devices now come with modern touchscreens, allowing you to control your home security and automation with the simple swipe of a finger. Run the software that came with your camera to set a password for the camera, and to see the IP address your router has assigned it. Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
