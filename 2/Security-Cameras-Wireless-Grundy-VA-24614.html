<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are.
