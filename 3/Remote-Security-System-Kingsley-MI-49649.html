<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>Some DVRs also allow digital broadcasting of the video signal, thus acting like a network camera. We consider this the best method used today for your alarm system monitoring. A physical attack could be accompanied by a cyber attack on the video surveillance infrastructure, as a means of compromising the ability of the latter to detect the physical security incident.</p>
<p>From motion sensors and security cameras to alarms and triggered patrols, thwart thieves and potential intruders by catching bad guys in the act with a tailored security solution. Digital video cameras can be part of your integrated home security system. Like many video doorbells, the Arlo security cameras are equipped with two-way audio to communicate with any guests, and it can be integrated with an Alexa or Google smart home system.</p>
