Most of today's home security systems will offer some degree of smart home integration and it's a worthwhile add-on or enhancement for more complete control of many working parts of the home. Join up surveillance efforts and quickly analyze data to deliver timely monitoring and surveillance across your security landscape.</p>
<p>If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. Wireless home security systems are easy to customize with add-ons like window sensors and surveillance cameras, so you can create a system that makes you feel safe even in a larger home. The most expensive package, Home Complete with Video, lets you add video surveillance with a doorbell camera and one indoor security camera.</p>
