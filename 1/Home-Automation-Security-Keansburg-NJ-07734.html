The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras.
