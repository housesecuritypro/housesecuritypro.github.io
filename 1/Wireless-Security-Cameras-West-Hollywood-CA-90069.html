A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that.

<p>The Smart Security Monitoring plan offers streamlined automation with minimal gadgetry, while the Smart Home Monitoring plan offers support for smart thermostats, lights, and garage door openers.
