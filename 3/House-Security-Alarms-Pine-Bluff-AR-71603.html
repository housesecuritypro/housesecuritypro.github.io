<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. The global video surveillance market was valued at $42.94 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $144.85 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2027. A key-operated switch in the sounder circuit allows you to turn the alarm system completely off when it is not needed. When the lights are switched ON, the intruder feels that he has been detected and the owner is trying to confirm this.</p>
<p>DVRs evolved from the older VCR models, while NVRs represent the next step in the evolution of video recording technology.
