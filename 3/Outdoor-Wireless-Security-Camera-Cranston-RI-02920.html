<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want. Monitoring for professionally installed systems tends to be more expensive.</p>
<p>In modern digital cameras the video image is already in a digital form - ready for processing. Remote temperature monitoring systems help you keep an eye on your property, so you can intervene as soon as issues occur.

The specialty of these cameras is that they capture video at 2 MP resolutions.</p>
