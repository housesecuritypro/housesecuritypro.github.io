<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>Factors we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
