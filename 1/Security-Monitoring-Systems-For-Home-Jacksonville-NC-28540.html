<p>HYDERABAD: Since the formation of Telangana State, CCTV cameras have become an essential part of policing. Nearly 100,000^ burglaries happen at an address that has been burgled before, new figures obtained by security company ADT and independent charity Victim Support reveal. Most of the burglar alarms today employ sirens that are wired into the home's electrical source.</p>
<p>These growing surveillance requirements are in-turn, driving demand to broadly deploy digital video surveillance systems with capabilities that include panoramic, high-definition IP-based cameras, Digital and Network Video Recorders, video management software, indexing applications, facial recognition technology, big data analysis and the storage media to capture and retain it all for as much as 365 days.</p>
