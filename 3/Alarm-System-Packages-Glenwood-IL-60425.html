Use it to check out the alarm company with the appropriate authorities: your state Attorney General , local consumer protection agency , Better Business Bureau , and state licensing officials If the salesperson is reluctant to give you this information, consider it a red flag and find another company to consider.</p>

Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks — and the industrial complex driving it.</p>
