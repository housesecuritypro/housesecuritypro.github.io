<p>Nest is pricier than most other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you want to monitor your system yourself.

Our solution ensures that relevant information can be shared and made available to all operators without compromising network, system and data security.</p>
<p>At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed. Home Value Monitoring is free, and it only takes a minute to set up. Just enter the address of the property you want to monitor — it's that easy.</p>

ADT Labs engineers put our security touchscreen panels through hundreds of hours of testing to ensure they'll perform in real-life scenarios when your health and safety may be at stake.</p>
