<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>Woot has also posted great deals on wireless security systems in the past. It's easy to arm and disarm through the app or Nest Tag, and the Nest Detect sensors can be placed on a window, door, or wall. The camera can also store the video to a local network drive such as a NAS or a shared folder on a PC on the same network. These types of camera lenses have ultra-wide viewing angles that can capture video in both the 180 degrees and 360 degrees FOV.</p>
<p>Prevention is always better, so dummy alarm boxes and outdoor security cameras and lights are also great options. Nest uses the same monitoring centers as Brinks, but offers the monitoring service at a lower monthly cost.

Let's take a closer look at the months that we've posted deals on wireless security systems and the stores they've come from over the years.</p>
<p>Both analog and IP cameras use CCDs, and the number of pixels across their horizontal and vertical dimensions is an important factor in determining image resolution.
