During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and use — but not quite as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. AxxonSoft is a leading developer of Video Management and Physical Security Information Management software. However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night.</p>
<p>For that reason, security companies offer some of the best deals and sales for home security during this time. In future, the police will be installing cameras with facial recognition feature.
