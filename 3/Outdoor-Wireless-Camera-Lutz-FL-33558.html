<p>So, whether it is recognizing fire hazard at a warehouse or counting people at a retail store, identifying aggressive behavior (or theft) and spontaneously letting the security officer or monitoring staff performance in a hotel, hospital, or an educational institute, the IP-driven solutions have unlocked unprecedented opportunities by leveraging video analytics, which isn't possible using conventional analog-based devices.</p>
<p>Features to look for include geofencing, which uses your phone's location services to lock and unlock the door, voice activation using Siri (HomeKit), Google Assistant, or Amazon Alexa voice commands, support for IFTTT, and integration with other smart home devices such as video doorbells, outdoor cameras, thermostats, smoke alarms, and connected lighting.</p>
<p>Video doorbells offer an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get close to the door. You'll also be able to monitor the video being recorded through the app, go through previously recorded footage, and check environmental markers like temperature. Most outdoor security cameras have an IP66 rating, which means they offer complete protection from dust ingress and can handle water jets from any direction, but shouldn't be immersed in water.</p>
