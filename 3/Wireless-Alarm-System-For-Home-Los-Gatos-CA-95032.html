<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Not great, not terrible, but with a really easy setup process (and trust me, that really is a killer feature when it comes to smart cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank. The most important thing you need to consider when recording security cameras is to select a suitable NVR or DVR.
