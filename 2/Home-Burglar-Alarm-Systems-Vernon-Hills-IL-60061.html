<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. It's one thing to say it but another thing to mean it. For as many years as we've been in the business, we have yet to come across anyone else who spends as much time with their customers as we do. You don't need to have an expert knowledge of CCTV systems, just a helpful and willing support staff that's more than happy to assist you with anything you may need.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>It is clear that the direction the video security industry is taking is the integration of the video security function with digital computing technology and the other parts of the security system: access control, intrusion alarms, fire, and two-way communications. Motion sensors offer backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. Also, the price of our CCTV cameras is quite affordable, and we offer a wide range of choice in terms of different products to help our customers choose the best based on their specific requirements.</p>
