But Atos, EMC and local security providers, such as Chubb in the UK, have come together to deliver the only end-to-end Managed Digital Video Surveillance service spanning consult, design, build and operate.

<p>A smart TV, media players connected to the TV, smart lights, smart appliances, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, smart displays such as Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub, smart cameras, a water purifier or air purifier that connects with the internet and so on. The thing is, none of these smart devices have any security built in.
