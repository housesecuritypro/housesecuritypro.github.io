You have CCTV cameras coming with range as long as 25 to 30 metres as well. In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. The amount of digital images captured on a DVR is determined by a few factors including the frames per second recorded, the amount of cameras hooked up to the DVR device, the resolution that the DVR saves the images at, and the video compression used (e.g. MPEG4).</p>
<p>Video surveillance systems and accessories deter theft and vandalism and record offenders. In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems often can use broadband signaling as a method of alarm transmission, and manufacturers are including IP reporting capability directly in their alarm panel products.
