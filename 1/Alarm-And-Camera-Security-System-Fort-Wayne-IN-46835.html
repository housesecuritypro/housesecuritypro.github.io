<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>

<p>We also recommend adding a doorbell video camera at some point. Receive video clips of unauthorized entry sent to your smartphone. Home alarm systems can help protect many different aspects of you and your family's day-to-day life, so it's often worth the investment for safety, security, and peace of mind.
