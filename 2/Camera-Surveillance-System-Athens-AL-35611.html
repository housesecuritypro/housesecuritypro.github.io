<p>To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically alert the control panel, setting off the alarm.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation.
