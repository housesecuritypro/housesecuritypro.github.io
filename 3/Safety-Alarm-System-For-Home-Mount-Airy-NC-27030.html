And while there are varying styles for these two types of security cameras, the differences will become more apparent once you compare their features, so there's no need to separate them further. In RUNG002, latching has to be provided in order to keep the alarm ringing even if the detection by the sensors are momentary or to be accurate, pulsating.</p>
