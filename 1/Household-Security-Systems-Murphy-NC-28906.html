<p>It is clear that the direction the video security industry is taking is the integration of the video security function with digital computing technology and the other parts of the security system: access control, intrusion alarms, fire, and two-way communications.

<p>Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road.

<p>Access video and audio feeds from any camera connected to the vulnerable cloud service; remotely gain root access to a camera and use it as an entry-point for further attacks on other devices on both local and external networks; remotely upload and execute arbitrary malicious code on the cameras; steal personal information such as user's social network accounts and information which is used to send users notifications; and remotely disable vulnerable cameras.</p>
<p>The majority of security systems come with wireless sensors that can be placed in strategic locations around your home, like on doors or windows and in living rooms and bedrooms. Once all connected together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensor, you will receive an alert on your phone.
