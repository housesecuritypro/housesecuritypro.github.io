<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.

Operational surveillance requirements mean a higher number of deployed cameras - ranging from tens to thousands - with higher digital resolutions that in-turn drive increased networking bandwidth, storage performance and the capacity to retain recordings for months.</p>
