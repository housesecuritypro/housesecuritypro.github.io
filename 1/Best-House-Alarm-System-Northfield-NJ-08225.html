<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings. Slash the time spent manually looking through backlogs of video footage seeking evidence and cross-checking to build a comprehensive picture. Manage your system and smart devices, get intelligent alerts, HD video, and more â€” so you're always in the know.</p>

If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensors and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment.</p>
<p>Compatible with both iOS and Android devices, this intelligent doorbell uses WiFi to connect to an app and give you a live view of your front door. Vivint continues to monitor its security systems for emergencies but is making adjustments in other ways during the COVID-19 pandemic.
