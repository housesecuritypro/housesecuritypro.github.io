<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>From a webcam to monitor a home to an IP-camera network serving an international business, Ivideon can handle it. Non-monitored Security Systems: There are plenty of DIY security systems available today that don't include professionally monitored services. CCTV also allows ensuring a remote control from video cameras through Internet on any personal device (tablet, smart phone, desktop).</p>
<p>Intelligent video surveillance lies at the core of the intelligent world, enabling sensory connections on a global scale, acting as the connecting point of the physical and digital worlds, and serving as a powerful catalyst for the digital and intelligent transformation of industry. Home automation features: Devices with home automation capabilities are compatible with IFTTT, Google Assistant, Google Home, Nest, Amazon Alexa, Hue, Ecobee, LIFX, Yale, Z-Wave, First Alert, Zigbee and more.</p>

Ring Alarm is a high-quality DIY home security system with smart features and great responsiveness. Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away.</p>
<p>Ring doesn't offer equipment packages; however, you can choose from a variety of doorbell and exterior lighting security cameras that range from $99.99-$499.00 and they have plenty of accompanying accessories. SMART Connect is a free home security smartphone app developed by Protect America that allows remote control from anywhere. Whether you're away on vacation, or just busy at work, environmental control systems allow you to monitor the environment of your home.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify. With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>
