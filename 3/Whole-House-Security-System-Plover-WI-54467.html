<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips. There are three types of cameras based on lighting and resolution. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
<p>Whether you manage one location or 1,000, an effective video surveillance system serves as a crime deterrent as well as a key method to capture and document security events on your premises. Note that even where Guard response is not available, you can still benefit from our home monitoring services.
