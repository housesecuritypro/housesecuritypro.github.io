<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
