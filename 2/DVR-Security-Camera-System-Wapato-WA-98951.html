<p>Factors we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>

This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home components in your house. For instance, there are extremely small surveillance cameras that are used for spying (Nanny Cams), night viewing, are vandal resistant, and that are specifically made for indoor or outdoor uses.</p>

Outdoor video cameras play a very important role in law enforcement by not only capturing video of potential criminals but also by preventing crimes. They'll also send an alert to your phone when someone or something is out there, record video of the event, and depending on features, let you talk to whoever is on your property, all without ever having to open your door (or even be inside your house, for that matter).</p>
