<p>The research methodology used to estimate and forecast the video surveillance market begins with capturing data on revenues of the key vendors in the market through secondary research. IP cameras are easier to install than analog cameras because they do not require a separate cable run or power boost to send images over a longer distance.

Complement public space safety systems with innovations such as Body Worn Video technology for police and security teams. You can save money with a wireless, unmonitored home security system since you don't pay a monthly monitoring fee or upfront installation cost.</p>
