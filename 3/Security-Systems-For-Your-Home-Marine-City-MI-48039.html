<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and use — but not quite as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. AxxonSoft is a leading developer of Video Management and Physical Security Information Management software.

Many providers offer smart home devices and or integration features that you can purchase as part of a security system package or as a standalone product. Some of the arguments invoked by law enforcement authorities to justify their use of video surveillance are that it helps prevent crime and that there is no expectation of privacy in public spaces.</p>
<p>You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. The advent of 360o cameras equipped with video de-warping technology is eliminating the need to deploy 3 to 4 PTZ (or the standard CCTV) cameras to cover a single region, as a single device can now effectively do the same. But Nest Aware is now a far more appealing proposition for those looking to kit their homes out with multiple security cameras.</p>

<p>Home alarm systems not only protect homes from potential thieves, they also protect family members from violent intruders, they can allow parents to prevent children from using potentially unsafe appliances when home alone, and can alert homeowners to fire, smoke, and the presence of dangerous carbon monoxide. The public is paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over.</p>
<p>We expect this trend to continue in the future and for the cybersecurity maturity gap between this industry and other high-tech industries to continue to shrink as more external pressure is applied on the people managing physical security systems. Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>
