<p>Both analog and IP cameras use CCDs, and the number of pixels across their horizontal and vertical dimensions is an important factor in determining image resolution.

With this, you can typically arm and disarm your security system from anywhere in the world via a web-enabled device, monitor who arrives and leaves your home, as well as use a panic button to elicit an instant response from your alarm monitoring company.</p>
<p>Most Sensaphone devices offer real-time status reports, so you can check on the house while you're away. Wireless home security systems are great for renters and homeowners alike since the sensors are easily removable - you can take them with you to a new home or apartment if you move or relocate, for example. Wired home security systems can also incorporate some wireless components, including motion detectors and smart home automation features.</p>

If the form of the identity card is "machine-readable", usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number (such as a Social Security number ), it corroborates the subject's identifying data.</p>
