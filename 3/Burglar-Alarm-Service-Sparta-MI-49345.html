IP cameras are easier to install than analog cameras because they do not require a separate cable run or power boost to send images over a longer distance.

<p>In an in-house monitoring system a monitor would be assigned responsibility for a trial being managed outside their usual working group. When a CCTV camera spots something of interest, a recorder ensures you can go back and view it later. The display unit for your CCTV system can range from a simple monochrome screen to an HD color monitor.
