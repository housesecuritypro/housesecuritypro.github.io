<p>Hi there, generally speaking, you will have to connect your IP security camera to the router to complete the initial setup of the camera and network settings. The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators (mains power loss, low battery, broken wire, etc.).</p>
<p>Many top security system companies may also offer environmental sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors for fire and flood detection, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors to monitor indoor air quality in real time. Alarm means for producing an alarm when said burglar alarm is armed and more than a predetermined current is drawn from said battery.</p>
