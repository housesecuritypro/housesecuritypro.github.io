Sonitrol Western Canada can provide CCTV video surveillance support for interior and exterior video surveillance solutions that range in size from centrally monitored, total corporate systems (fully-networked with dedicated fibre optic backbones) to PC-controlled, IP-based, stand-alone remote access verifiers. To view live or recorded footage from your security cameras, you must hook up your DVR or NVR to a TV or monitor.</p>
<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable. The main features of these security cameras are its high resolution and scalability. Operational surveillance requirements mean a higher number of deployed cameras - ranging from tens to thousands - with higher digital resolutions that in-turn drive increased networking bandwidth, storage performance and the capacity to retain recordings for months.</p>
