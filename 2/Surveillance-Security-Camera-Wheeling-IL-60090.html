<h3>Home Security Systems: More Than Simply Having An Alarm In Place in Wheeling</h3>
<p>Smart locks, smart thermostats, the ability to remotely turn lights off and on, arm or disarm the system from anywhere, and remote camera access are all modern features that can be integrated into any quality home security system for even more convenience and control. IP (Internet protocol) cameras carry out the same functions as their analog counterparts, but with vastly greater capabilities.</p>
<p>In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. In 2015 RPA teamed up with Shawn Soeder, one of our Passive House clients, an engineer by training who has experience in information technology, to create the specifications and installation instructions for an Arduino -based Passive House IoT Climate Monitoring and Reporting System.</p>
<p>Motion Sensing: Some cameras will only record when they notice motion, saving lots of space and energy while only capturing footage when someone is in the room.

AI powers the surveillance cameras enabling them to analyze the live video.</p>

<p>The LPR cameras or the License Plate Recognition cameras can capture images of objects moving at high speeds. Network of devices: Scout hub and mobile apps work with home alarms, motion sensors, access sensors, door panels and indoor home security cameras. 5G technology is driving extraordinary new ways of using high-quality video in real time.

<p>As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest.
