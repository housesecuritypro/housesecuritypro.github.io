<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has quickly become significant security equipment for safety and monitoring purposes. A single four rack unit E-Series chassis can be configured with up to 480TB in capacity, making it 10X more dense with an improvement in rack space efficiency of up to 5X over that of other Digital Video Surveillance offerings.</p>
<p>These wall-mounted devices now come with modern touchscreens, allowing you to control your home security and automation with the simple swipe of a finger. Run the software that came with your camera to set a password for the camera, and to see the IP address your router has assigned it. Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
<p>Our wide range of affordable, high-quality CCTV products is sure to be the perfect addition to your company's security efforts. They offer an easy do-it-yourself security system with technologically-advanced equipment. But, the jewellery shops have been reluctant to keep burglar alarms connected to police stations. Even those home security cameras which are plugged in a socket are wireless in one sense.</p>

Although video motion detection and video analytics (Chapter 7) apply technology to identify anomalies that human observers may miss, security management should take action to reduce fatigue and ensure good-quality viewing.</p>

Yes, some security systems have motion sensors that are designed to avoid detecting pets up to a certain weight.
