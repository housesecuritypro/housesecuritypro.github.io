In the last couple of years, the company started offering additional security solutions like modern, easy-to-use equipment, which integrate well and offers smart home compatibility.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>A pair of input leads, each lead being for connection to one of two spaced apart points of the electrical system, said points being selected to produce a detectable voltage between said input leads when current is drawn from said battery by said at least one device. Many leading providers of monitored home security systems (such as ADT and Vivint ) require professional installation to make sure everything is in working order.</p>

<p>In the event of an incident, our alarm system instantly notifies the monitoring service and authorities will be dispatched. The IP surveillance system is made up of two components—IP-based camera that records video content using a network video recorder (NVR) and video surveillance platform that captures and distributes the video content through the network.</p>
<p>Link Interactive also offers extra sensors that most security companies don't. We have options for analog CCTV, IP, and HDCVI systems. Professional installation can also be especially helpful if your home is large, if you get stressed by DIY projects, and for countless other reasons. The cameras at the doors are linked to contact alarms so that each time a door is opened, loss prevention personnel receive an e-mail.</p>
<p>Our cameras offer efficient network utilization and high-quality video. Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well.

It's professionally installed, it will look good in your house, and it supports a ton of smart home devices.

Slash the time spent manually looking through backlogs of video footage seeking evidence and cross-checking to build a comprehensive picture.
