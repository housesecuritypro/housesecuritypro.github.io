<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>It's built around the Nest Secure alarm system, so it's no surprise that it integrates with Google Assistant, which allows you to control the system with your voice. Deliver greater insight in smart cities, factories or environmental applications with real time high-definition video and AI-driven analytics. Big investments by the likes of Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have made home security cameras more prominent.</p>
