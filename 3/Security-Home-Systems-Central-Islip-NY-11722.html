<p>Motion detection: Assuming you're monitoring your home when it's empty, motion detection is one of the most desirable features in a security camera. When an alarm is triggered, trained professionals take the appropriate action: alerting your emergency contacts, dispatching Guard Response (where available) to verify intrusion alarms, and alerting the appropriate responders - e.g. police, fire dept, ambulance - if an emergency is confirmed.</p>
<p>Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely.
