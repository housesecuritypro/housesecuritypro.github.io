Ella can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language queries, letting users search footage to find clips showing specific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, or even individual car makes and models. These Decoders are equipped with powerful capabilities and can manage a flexible display of IP cameras on LCD video walls. When a door or window is shut, the contact of the door or window in the frame is detected by door and window sensors.</p>
