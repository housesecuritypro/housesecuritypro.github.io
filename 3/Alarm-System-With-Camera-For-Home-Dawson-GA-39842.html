<p>The best in smart home security systems. The Wyze Cam V2's video is on par with that of most of the cameras on our list. Besides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. Network video servers are designed for IP CCTV cameras over WAN or LAN computer networks where each camera has its own unique IP address.

With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>

In addition, specialized cameras exist that are capable of providing higher-resolution imagery and extensive areal coverage using a combination of multiple fixed cameras in conjunction with a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) device.

<p>Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about. With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
