<p>DIY home security systems come in all shapes and sizes. Video walls offer a very big screen so that many people can watch the captured videos from a number of cameras at the same time. If only a single tube is used, the alarm relay is placed in the plate circuit of the vacuum tube and the potentials are so adjusted that the plate current is high when the light is falling on the cell, and the grid voltage only slightly negative or even positive.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
