<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. Displays upto 16 cameras (from different locations) on a screen at the same time with 18 zoom, 360° pan and 90 tilt features. Thermography Bullet Cameras feature temperature measurement with a range of -20°C to 550°C (-4°F to 1,022°F) with an accuracy of ±2°C, or ±2%. With monitoring services starting at $8.95 per month, everyone can protect what's most precious to them.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given. Weather-ready wired networks let you scatter a combination of dome, turret or bullet cameras around your home-or even multiple properties-to ensure total coverage. Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>
<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service. We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it.
