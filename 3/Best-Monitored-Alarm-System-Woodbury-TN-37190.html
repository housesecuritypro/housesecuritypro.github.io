<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Choose DIY when you don't want to pay an installation fee (which usually runs around $100, sometimes more). When you add other Ring products to Ring Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way communication, and smart lighting.
