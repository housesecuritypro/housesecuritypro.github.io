<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>

Use one powerful app to manage when and how your smart devices work together.</p>

<p>Many ADT installation packages roll together equipment fees with professional installation. Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage.

In addition, many CCTV cameras even have night vision capabilities that allow a CCTV camera to view and record low light images using special technology.
