<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>ADT Pulse still allows remote control of your security system and smart home devices without the panel while using the Pulse app. Security Info Watch has created a handy primer on compression technology if you're looking to delve into the details of video compression.
