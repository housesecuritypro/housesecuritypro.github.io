<p>Start with the basics, then choose the sensors and cameras that best suit your living situation. A multiplexer is a device that takes multiple video images and lays them onto a VHS tape, it uses the properties of the PAL signal to record as many images from multiple cctv cameras every second as possible. Use it to check out the alarm company with the appropriate authorities: your state Attorney General , local consumer protection agency , Better Business Bureau , and state licensing officials If the salesperson is reluctant to give you this information, consider it a red flag and find another company to consider.</p>
<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
