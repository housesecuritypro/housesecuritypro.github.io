<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>From a webcam to monitor a home to an IP-camera network serving an international business, Ivideon can handle it.

<p>When you have cameras as part of your security system , those videos must be stored somewhere. Unmonitored home security systems: Unmonitored security systems rely on notifications and the sound of the alarm to prevent intrusions.
