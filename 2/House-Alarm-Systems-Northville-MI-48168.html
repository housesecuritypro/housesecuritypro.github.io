At least a 720p resolution is pretty standard for home security cameras these days, but some now offer an even better resolution than that.</p>

We've tried out a number of smart home-security systems to see how easy they are to set up and use, and asked a security expert to assess how likely they are to deter an intruder. Our team of experienced CCTV installers can supply, install and maintain your security cameras and CCTV security systems and ensure that they are operating effectively and to your satisfaction.</p>
