As with just about every smart home device out there, many DIY security systems can be armed and disarmed using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Increasing concerns about public safety and security, growing adoption of IP cameras, and rising demand for wireless and spy cameras are the factors driving the growth of the video surveillance market.</p>
<p>Wired security cameras use cables to transmit footage and conduct video surveillance, but the signal can weaken when the transmission range exceeds 300 meters.

<p>In accordance with the invention, a burglar alarm of an automotive vehicle having an electrical system including a battery, battery cables, at least one electrical device for drawing current from the battery, a switch for controlling current flow from the battery to the device and the charging means for supplying charging current to the battery, comprises a direct current coupled input means for providing a voltage directly proportional to the amount of current interchanged between the battery and the electrical system of the automobile; an arming means responsive to the voltage for arming said burglar alarm only when less than a first predetermined current is interchanged between the battery and the electrical system; and an alarm means for producing an alarm when the alarm is armed and more than a second predetermined amount of current is drawn from said battery.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move.

Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.
