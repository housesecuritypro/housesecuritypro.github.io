<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Many cheap security systems have extra features too. Monitoring services are performed by a third party monitoring service with an 30-second average response time. Sensors can detect intruders by a variety of methods, such as monitoring doors and windows for opening, or by monitoring unoccupied interiors for motions, sound, vibration, or other disturbances.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system. The home security market offers many plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to deter intruders who trigger a door or window sensor. In areas of cellular communication, the SAT130 can provide high-speed IP communications to IP cameras for streaming video, video and image files.</p>

It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular. While less expensive security cameras have single duplex audio — meaning you can talk and listen, but only one at a time — full-duplex audio — both sides can talk and listen simultaneously is even better.</p>

Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
