<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Equipped with superb imaging ability and backed by 50x zoom ratio and the patented DarkFighterX technology, as well as intelligent functions like smart tracking and false alarm filtering, Ultra Series cameras provide comprehensive assistance to customers. These are some of the few factors that are further adding to the impressive growth rate of the Indian surveillance industry, paving the way for it to nearly triple its current market size to reach $2.4 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. Because of the home automation feature, you have the option to install the Frontpoint app and gain remote control over your security system, alarm history and visitor activity.</p>
