In addition, many CCTV cameras even have night vision capabilities that allow a CCTV camera to view and record low light images using special technology.

<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
<p>The company only offers professional installation and 100% wireless systems. All of our HD security cameras and equipment are designed using the latest technology and top-quality components for superior video clarity.
