<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>

When this occurs, the output of flip-flop 72, which is provided to the enable input of an entry delay timer 86, causes entry delay timer 86 to begin an entry delay interval.</p>
