<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. This same design is commonly used for Window Sensors, too, where a switch is placed in the window frame and a magnet in the door itself. Video surveillance systems (or CCTV) have evolved significantly in the last several years.

<p>As for the wearable cameras, it's hard to spot them if someone is recording you. Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino to develop a system for monitoring and controlling your home. Use the ADT mobile app to view your security cameras through your mobile device.

<p>3 Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours. However, during night time and in poorly lit areas infrared or thermal cameras are used that gives black and white images. Trial monitoring can be built into people's roles so they do not do this full time.</p>
<p>The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
