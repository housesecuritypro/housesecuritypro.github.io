<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. This is the reason behind the increasing demand of CCTV Cameras. Reduce DVS Storage Total Cost of Ownership: E-Series' unique chassis design reduces scaling complexities that arise with less efficient storage systems. The most basic burglar alarm systems monitor the perimeter of a home or building for breaches, such as opening a door or breaking a window. With F1.0 large aperture and advanced sensor, Hikvision ColorVu cameras produce colorful and sharp videos with clear details in most scenarios.</p>
<p>If you're looking for high definition at a budget we recommend HDCVI cameras that are available at 720P and 1080P resolutions. CCTV is a television system where the signals are not publicly distributed, but are primarily for surveillance and security purposes internally.

IP security cameras send their signals over a network, allowing greater information transfer than an analog signal sent to a digital video recorder (DVR).
