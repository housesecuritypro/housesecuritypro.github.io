<p>If you want a video surveillance system without a home security system, we've got lots of recommendations in our best home security camera systems post. The standard Alarm Security Kit is priced at just $199 - cheaper than most competitors - yet comes with a base station, keypad, contact sensor, motion detector and range extender. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>ADT Pulse app: Through the ADT Pulse app, you can arm or disarm your home security system, monitor for your home for break-ins and disasters and receive text alerts and email notifications.
