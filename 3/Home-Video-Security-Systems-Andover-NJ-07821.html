<p>Founded in 2004, Ohio AMS has been proudly serving Ohio's courts and corrections industry with high quality monitoring products and services for over a decade. Video surveillance, access control and alarms have much in common, and they often work together as an integrated system to keep intruders out of secure areas, limit access to security sensitive areas, and remotely monitor critical areas to reduce the risk of crime and security incidents. You can also check out our guide to the best home security cameras for more options.</p>
<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>
<p>Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording. It lets you arm and disarm your home security system, control smart devices and check in on your home - from virtually anywhere. Turn off lights, lock doors and arm your security system with a single phrase or control panel touchscreen tap. We will continue to challenge ourselves to exceed our customers' expectations by employing industry proven best practices, hiring professionals in the field, reinvesting in our infrastructure and state of the art technology, and constantly improving our monitoring processes.</p>

<h3>Home Security Systems: More Than Simply Having An Alarm In Place in Andover</h3>
