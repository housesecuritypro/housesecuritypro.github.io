<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want. Monitoring for professionally installed systems tends to be more expensive.</p>
<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that captures video at 720p will usually offer a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video offers more detail and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it doesn't require lots of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>
<p>A nice geofencing feature comes built with the camera, which automatically arms or disarms the monitoring system. Qumulo scales via Ethernet attached storage and processor nodes, which is ideal for integration with video management solutions. Plus, if you sign up for premium service, you get a lifetime equipment warranty on all that cool gear. The special application cameras have a gamut of uses such as in defence establishments, underwater surveillance, and other covert operations.</p>
