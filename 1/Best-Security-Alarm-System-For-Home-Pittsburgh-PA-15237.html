Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>

Network cameras can be wireless and still work through a network and are used in big departmental stores, food chains, malls, factory, work shop, and many other public places to keep a check of the activities.</p>
<p>When a camera is triggered, an ADT monitoring professional will immediately check the video and call you to confirm an intrusion. If an intruder alarm sensor in your home is triggered we'll respond immediately and contact you. Burglar (or intrusion), fire and safety alarms are commonly found in electronic form today. However, most hardwired systems require professional installation.</p>

Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction.
