<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level. Electronics can be disturbed by means such as microwave emissions, whose pulses can incapacitate conventional alarm systems or cause an unwanted alarm.” What's more, the system's pattern recognition capability prevents false alarms triggered by everyday vibrations.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>

Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well.

Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression — ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated.
