If only a single tube is used, the alarm relay is placed in the plate circuit of the vacuum tube and the potentials are so adjusted that the plate current is high when the light is falling on the cell, and the grid voltage only slightly negative or even positive.</p>
<p>NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies.
