<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. From door, window and motion sensors to mobile apps and cameras, we'll build the perfect alarm system for your home.
