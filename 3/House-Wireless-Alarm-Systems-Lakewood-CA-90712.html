<p>Heightened physical security concerns spanning all industries, coupled with technological advancements is driving the requirement for higher camera resolutions, more fields of view with wider dynamic range and longer storage retention periods. The Internet of Things has made it easier than ever to set up a smart home in which you can remotely control your door locks, lights, thermostats, vacuums , lawn mowers , and even pet feeders, using your smartphone and an app. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. 29.1% of Americans own a DIY home security product, such as a video doorbell, self-monitored system, or a smart lock.</p>

Keep an eye on with what you care about at any time from anywhere; just like a security camera.</p>

<p>With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly fees if you decide to self-monitor. Alarm Relay is a TMA Five Diamond monitoring center. Although video motion detection and video analytics (Chapter 7) apply technology to identify anomalies that human observers may miss, security management should take action to reduce fatigue and ensure good-quality viewing.</p>
<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
