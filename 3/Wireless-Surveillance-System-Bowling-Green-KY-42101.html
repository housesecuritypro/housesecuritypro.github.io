<p>They are often connected to a recording device or IP network , and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable database , and by video analysis software (such as VIRAT and HumanID ). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected.</p>
<p>If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.
