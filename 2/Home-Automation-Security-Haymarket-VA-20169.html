<p>This smart indoor camera by Qubo is not any ordinary security gadget it's A.I. enabled. The Mi Home Security Camera Basic sports a full HD 1080p sensor that also has a viewing angle of 130 degrees and helps you capture a wider area of your surveillance spot. Ultra Series Cameras capture ultra-high quality and high definition videos. The Frontpoint alarm panel also serves as a Z-wave smart home hub, but its ability to integrate with some top smart home brands (like Google Nest) is limited.</p>
<p>Nest's parent company is Google and they offer 100% DIY wireless equipment, except for the Guard hub which has to be placed on a flat surface by the door you use most often. There is a wide range of explosion proof digital cameras system available in the market, and you might get confused about the best purchase. But, like Vivint, ADT comes professionally installed and its monitoring centers are super reliable.</p>
