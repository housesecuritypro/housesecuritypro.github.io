<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. And sometimes, motion sensors can do the job of several entry sensors. This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>The display lets you communicate with a professional monitoring service when an alarm is triggered and view video from any of the installed security cameras.
