<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms.

However, an engine start will cause comparator 42 to provide a logic high signal output due to charging of battery 10, thus resetting arming timer 50, and preventing an alarm from being sounded, as described below.</p>
