CCTV Camera World is a seller of security cameras, video recorders (DVR, NVR, Hybrid, Tribrid), surveillance systems, and all other things CCTV. For example, we love the Abode Iota, which combines your alarm system's hub with a night vision indoor security camera. Our solution eliminates the need to store recordings of all videos from every camera in the video servers.</p>
<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone.
