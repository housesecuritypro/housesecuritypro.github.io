<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has quickly become significant security equipment for safety and monitoring purposes.

Many providers offer smart home devices and or integration features that you can purchase as part of a security system package or as a standalone product.

Hybrid digital video recorders (HDVRs) support IP cameras.

<p>But just like Netgear, they've also ventured into digital home solutions, specifically remote home monitoring systems.

The system also integrates with smart home devices from other manufacturers, including Arlo home security cameras and the August Smart Lock Pro These can be installed at the same time as the system or added in later on. That's a nice change from systems like Vivint Smart Home, which only works with its own components.</p>

Because of its range of self- and professionally monitored plans, Abode is our top pick for the diehard DIYer.</p>
<p>Some systems offer indoor and outdoor cameras, portable equipment, and cell alerts, among other features. Interested in surveillance systems using specialized cameras.
