<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. It sounds fancy and sophisticated, but Remote Control is a home security feature that comes with many affordable systems. And some security cameras, like Reolink Argus 2 , have an SD card slot, which allows you to have the option to put into your own Micro SD card for motion event recording. Sensors If you don't want a camera in every room you should install a motion detector (at least in the hallways) that can send alerts and set of an alarm.</p>

<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike.
