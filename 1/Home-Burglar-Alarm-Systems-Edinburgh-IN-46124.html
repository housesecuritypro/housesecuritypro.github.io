<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. The internet protocol (IP) based structure of the new surveillance systems takes into consideration versatility, adaptability, and digital security.

<p>Hi there, generally speaking, you will have to connect your IP security camera to the router to complete the initial setup of the camera and network settings. The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators (mains power loss, low battery, broken wire, etc.).</p>

However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>
<p>Curb shows customers where their energy is being used and how much is being generated, in real time and for less money than traditional solar monitoring systems. Many cameras offer free cloud storage for a limited number of days (typically seven) before it is overwritten or deleted, while others are strictly subscription based.
