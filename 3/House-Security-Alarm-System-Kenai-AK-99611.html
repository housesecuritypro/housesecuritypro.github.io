<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
<p>For most home systems, 1080p resolution, also called Full HD or FHD, is sufficient, but you can also pay more for 2K or 4K cameras, which have, respectively, two or four times as much resolution.

<p>Listen-in alarm monitoring is also known as Immediate Audio-Response monitoring or Speaking Alarm Systems in the UK. Monitored systems rely on professionals to watch for triggered alarms, contact system owners, and dispatch emergency services. CCTV cameras can also cover a wide area in addition to focusing on a particular spot. Depending on the manufacturer, your home security camera will store different amounts of footage for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of video surveillance systems is its ability to ensure full-time monitoring in both the densely populated areas as well as in remote areas. When these sensors are triggered, they send a signal to your security system control panel, which will alert your ADT monitoring station.

The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal. CCTV cameras also have the potential of creating unintended effects, good and bad.</p>
