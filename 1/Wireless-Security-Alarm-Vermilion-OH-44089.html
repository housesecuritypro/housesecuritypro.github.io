These cameras can pick up coloured images in very low-light conditions. This is to avoid false alarms wasting police time. Like any big purchase, it's smart to shop around for a while before deciding when and where to buy a wireless security system.

<p>Many people who are looking for DIY home security solutions want systems that they can install and monitor themselves. DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need them—perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs.
