There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum.
