<p>We have seen five CCTV cameras that are ideal for indoor use. For smaller and more specific needs, Home Controls provides several stand-alone and specialty security systems, including do-it-yourself (DIY) alert systems, wired and wireless driveway alarms, environmental reporting systems, security lighting and more.

<p>If you're not ready for a dedicated security system, there are plenty of individual devices available that let you monitor your home from anywhere using your phone or tablet, including indoor and outdoor security cameras, video doorbells, motion sensors, and smart locks. Sadly though, the camera only records video when it detects motion, which means there isn't a continuous recording feature.</p>

All of our HD security cameras and equipment are designed using the latest technology and top-quality components for superior video clarity. Note that the maximum recording time for a battery security camera is 5 minutes per day in case of power drainage.

<p>Listen-in alarm monitoring is also known as Immediate Audio-Response monitoring or Speaking Alarm Systems in the UK. Monitored systems rely on professionals to watch for triggered alarms, contact system owners, and dispatch emergency services.

Depending on the manufacturer, your home security camera will store different amounts of footage for different lengths of time.</p>
