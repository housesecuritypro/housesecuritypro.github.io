In terms of Reolink's NVRs, you won't be able to copy the video footage on DVD disks directly from the NVR in real time or over a certain time period.

Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an option, you may want to explore hidden cameras , which are cameras that are small and discreet, sometimes fitted into everyday objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.
