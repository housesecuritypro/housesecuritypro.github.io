<p>To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically alert the control panel, setting off the alarm. These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>
<p>Effective home security systems can guard your windows and doors, detect motion inside your home, and automatically contact dispatchers in the case of an emergency. These smart digital cameras can spot motion, detect objects, read vehicle number plates, and even identify human behaviors. Sound the siren on your Ring Alarm from anywhere inside your home and dispatch emergency services with professional monitoring.</p>

The resolution capability depends on how a particular CCTV camera is being used. Thanks to the rise in popularity of smart home technology, it's now easier than ever to secure your home with cameras, detectors, and sometimes even a control panel.</p>
