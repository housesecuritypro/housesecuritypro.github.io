<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>
<p>However, if you have a large house, are uncomfortable with wiring, or want extra features like motion-sensors and alarm systems, call a security firm near you.
