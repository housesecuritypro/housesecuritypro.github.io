<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>
<p>The Vivint starter system includes two entry sensors, one motion sensor and the control panel for $600.

<p>Alarm systems can alert homeowners to the arrival of strangers on their doorstep, and let homeowners remotely keep an eye on their front door for packages and deliveries.
