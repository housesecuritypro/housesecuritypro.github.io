<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>Value Series DVRs offer a cost-effective and high quality video surveillance solution with H.265 Pro+ and H.265 Pro compression technology, up to 5 MP Ultra HD encoding ability and great durability.

<p>Installation of CCTV cameras helps not only to prevent crimes due to visual control but also to charge criminals using the information recorded by video camera. IP security cameras send their signals over a network, allowing greater information transfer than an analog signal sent to a digital video recorder (DVR). In fact, CCTV systems have become so affordable, most smaller mom and pop stores also have CCTV systems in them for security purposes.</p>

<p>Analog cameras have been around for years and are still the most common type of CCTV camera installed today. In the event your battery is low, a low-battery signal will be sent to your ADT monitoring center so you can be notified. Resolution refers to the number of definable parts of the horizontal image produced by a camera, recorded by the video or digital video recorder and displayed on the monitor.</p>
<p>You can get monitoring contracts for wired or wireless alarms, but both the alarm itself and the installation must conform to certain standards - you won't be able to install it yourself. It wasn't all that long ago that having a home security system meant signing up with a company that would send a professional installer to your house to drill holes in your walls and run wires throughout your home.</p>

<p>Remember that the best camera security system you need will be your best friend to keep your family and belongings safe all times.
