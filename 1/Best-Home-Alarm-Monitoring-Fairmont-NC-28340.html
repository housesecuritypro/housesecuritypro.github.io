<p>Video surveillance systems and accessories deter theft and vandalism and record offenders. In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems often can use broadband signaling as a method of alarm transmission, and manufacturers are including IP reporting capability directly in their alarm panel products. Frontpoint security systems require a one-time activation fee of up to $199.</p>
<p>Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded.

<p>Although, there are some security companies who offer same day installation, but those are few and far between. The "motion sensing" feature on most lights (and security systems) is a passive system that detects infrared energy.
