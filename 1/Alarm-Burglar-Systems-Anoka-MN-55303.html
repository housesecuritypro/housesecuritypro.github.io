<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Not great, not terrible, but with a really easy setup process (and trust me, that really is a killer feature when it comes to smart cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.

As with just about every smart home device out there, many DIY security systems can be armed and disarmed using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Increasing concerns about public safety and security, growing adoption of IP cameras, and rising demand for wireless and spy cameras are the factors driving the growth of the video surveillance market.</p>
<p>IP surveillance cameras offer various benefits over analog surveillance such as real-time surveillance, remote accessibility, digital zooming capability, lower operational & infrastructure cost, greater integration potential, ease of data distribution, easy installation, and adjustable frame rates which boost the growth of the video surveillance market globally.</p>
