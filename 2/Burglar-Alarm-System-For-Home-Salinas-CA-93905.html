Hikvision's development of an AI cloud software platform and its adoption will promote the growth of IoT as well as advance the integration of IoT with information networks; it will also help develop the company's Big Data business.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
