Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>

<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike.
