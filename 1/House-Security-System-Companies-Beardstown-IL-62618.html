<p>Security and safety products such as basic burglar alarm systems , door and window detectors , motion detectors and sirens , are critical components in many security systems. You can also automate your home alarm system to send you email alerts when specific events happen, such as certain doors opening or closing or an alarm being turned off. A burglar alarm system consists of a series of electrical components that are connected to a property.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation.
