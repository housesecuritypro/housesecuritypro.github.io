<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. It's one thing to say it but another thing to mean it. For as many years as we've been in the business, we have yet to come across anyone else who spends as much time with their customers as we do. You don't need to have an expert knowledge of CCTV systems, just a helpful and willing support staff that's more than happy to assist you with anything you may need.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>
<p>You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. The advent of 360o cameras equipped with video de-warping technology is eliminating the need to deploy 3 to 4 PTZ (or the standard CCTV) cameras to cover a single region, as a single device can now effectively do the same. But Nest Aware is now a far more appealing proposition for those looking to kit their homes out with multiple security cameras.</p>
