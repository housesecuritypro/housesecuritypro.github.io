<p>Wireless DIY home alarms are generally less expensive than systems that require a professional technician to install, but many homeowners feel safer with a wired system. Active illumination of a scene with infrared light and special infrared detection equipment will sometimes be required for nighttime CCTV operation. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.</p>
