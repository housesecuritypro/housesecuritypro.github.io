<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. And now that the best systems are affordable, functional, and easy to use, there's really no reason not to find a security system that works for your budget and lifestyle. Installing CCTV cameras can not only serve as a strict deterrent and provide your employees a safer place to work, but also ensure any such reprehensible activities are caught in the act.</p>
<p>If you're looking for high definition at a budget we recommend HDCVI cameras that are available at 720P and 1080P resolutions. CCTV is a television system where the signals are not publicly distributed, but are primarily for surveillance and security purposes internally. As long as the magnetic field remains balanced with the door firmly closed, the contacts within the switch would be in no-alarm condition.</p>
<p>Installation of CCTV cameras helps not only to prevent crimes due to visual control but also to charge criminals using the information recorded by video camera. IP security cameras send their signals over a network, allowing greater information transfer than an analog signal sent to a digital video recorder (DVR). In fact, CCTV systems have become so affordable, most smaller mom and pop stores also have CCTV systems in them for security purposes.</p>
