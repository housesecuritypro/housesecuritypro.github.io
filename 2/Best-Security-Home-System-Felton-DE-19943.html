A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that.

Nest Secure comes with DIY and professional installation options, and the system is controlled through the Nest app. If you want to keep it DIY but add more home automation, Abode , Ring Alarm , or Nest Secure will work better for you.</p>
