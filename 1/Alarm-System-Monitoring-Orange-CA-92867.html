<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Outdoor security cameras can present more of a challenge, especially if the home's exterior has limited power sources, if you don't have many tools or if you are concerned about affecting your home's appearance. ADT Go is an app that helps provide peace of mind and reliable ADT emergency monitoring wherever you may go.

<p>For controlling and output for monitoring. When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>The Abode home security app can also integrate automation devices from third parties. Arlo is a home security camera system that's DIY and a 100% wireless installation.
