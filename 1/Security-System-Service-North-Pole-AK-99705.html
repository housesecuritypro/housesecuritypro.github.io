Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.</p>
<p>Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings. Slash the time spent manually looking through backlogs of video footage seeking evidence and cross-checking to build a comprehensive picture.
