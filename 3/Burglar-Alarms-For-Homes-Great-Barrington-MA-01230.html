<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Security Camera Surveillance: You can choose to add a video camera and monitor to your system so you can catch thieves in the act if they do choose to break into your home. For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. The other features that attract toward this security camera are Weatherproof, Night Vision, Multiple Alarms, Auto Focus, and Tamper Resistant.</p>

It's easy to arm and disarm through the app or Nest Tag, and the Nest Detect sensors can be placed on a window, door, or wall.

These types of camera lenses have ultra-wide viewing angles that can capture video in both the 180 degrees and 360 degrees FOV.</p>
