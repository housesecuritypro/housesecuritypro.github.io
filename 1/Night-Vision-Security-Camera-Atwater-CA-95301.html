<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud.

<h4>Wireless Video Security System Atwater 95301</h4>
<p>As the crime rate is increasing day by day and burglars are becoming smarter by every passing day, the security system for commercial setups likebanks, shops and houses need to be fool proof.

<p>Type of cameras to be used: There are many types of camera available on the market.

<p>And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place.
