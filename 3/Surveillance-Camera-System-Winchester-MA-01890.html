<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that.

Most of the monitoring tools that support ClickHouse at all lack official integrations with ClickHouse from their vendors, and in many cases the number of metrics that they can collect is limited.</p>
<p>The Iota works as a smart hub and security camera that you can control remotely via the Abode app. Dial things up and invest in a camera allowing you to monitor your home remotely while knowing it's protected by motion sensors that will trigger high-intensity floodlights and an audible alarm in the event of untoward movement being detected.
