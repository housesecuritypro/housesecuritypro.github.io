<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>The Traditional tier starts at about $129 for installation and $44.99 a month for monitoring, which includes two entry sensors, one motion sensor, a siren, keypad and remote. As with just about every smart home device out there, many DIY security systems can be armed and disarmed using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Increasing concerns about public safety and security, growing adoption of IP cameras, and rising demand for wireless and spy cameras are the factors driving the growth of the video surveillance market.</p>

<p>Studies in the West show that in public places, CCTV cameras have had negligible effect in preventing crimes. Home alarm equipment: Essential security equipment includes a wireless control panel, three door and window sensors, motion detections, security camera and yard sign. Entry-level video doorbell cameras let you see who's at the door without having to get up.</p>
<p>Despite this evidence, in the United States, current anti-terrorist fears, combined with the surge in road rage, the perception of an increase in crime, and several high-profile school shootings, are causing many to call for increased video surveillance not only on highways, in schools, public parks and government buildings, but in all public spaces.</p>
