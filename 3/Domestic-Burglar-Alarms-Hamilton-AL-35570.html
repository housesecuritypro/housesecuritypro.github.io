<p>Movement detectors are a common part of most smart homes and home security systems. Plus, SimpliSafe offers plenty of other add-ons, such as the SimpliSafe smart lock, video doorbell, and indoor SimpliCam. The PT Series includes speed dome cameras and positioning system cameras, which are all equipped with thermal and optical modules.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>Additional sensors can also be added at a fairly low cost, like a $70 smoke detector, additional motion detectors for $40 and a $120 camera that can be used indoors or outside.
