Based on our first-hand tests of the systems and myriad interviews with owners of each system, SimpliSafe is the better system for you if you're a renter and value having a portable system you can take with you when you move (or are unable to make changes to the house such as installing a hard-wired home alarm system like ADT).</p>
<p>From there, you can add cameras for another $110-$300 to see what's happening at home before calling the police or fire responders. PIR motion sensors are one of the intelligent home security systems that you should buy for your office or home.
