<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>2 wireless switch channel for remote control & door access (works with WS1, WS2). As it is connected in reverse bias fashion, when the light falls on it, it conducts and current flows through it.

<p>Expanding at a healthy CAGR, the CCTV camera market would create around two-fold revenue by 2029. These wireless video units typically consist of a remote camera, either battery powered or AC powered, and a base station to receive the signals.

<p>Home security has never been as easy and effortless as it is with the ADT Control app. Also, CCTV camera technology is steadily getting better, allowing you to benefit from high-tech wireless systems which are replacing older fiber optic wiring. The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future.</p>
