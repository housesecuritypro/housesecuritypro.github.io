<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>

<p>Technology has come such a long way that DIY systems can offer the same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. From a homeowners' point of view, you'll need to know whether you want a basic system, or one with more technologically advanced bells and whistles, such as home automation, smart home integration, and so on. Prices, monthly monitoring costs, and lengths of contracts can vary widely among various home security systems in the marketplace.</p>
