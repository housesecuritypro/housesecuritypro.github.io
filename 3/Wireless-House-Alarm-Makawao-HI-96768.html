The fire monitoring service is included in all our packages. Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
