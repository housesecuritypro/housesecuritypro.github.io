<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given. Weather-ready wired networks let you scatter a combination of dome, turret or bullet cameras around your home-or even multiple properties-to ensure total coverage. Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>
<p>Video security provides both an additional crime deterrent and an easy way to look in on your business throughout the day.

<p>Analog cameras have been around for years and are still the most common type of CCTV camera installed today. In the event your battery is low, a low-battery signal will be sent to your ADT monitoring center so you can be notified.

Usually, the outdoor cameras have high resolution in the range of 470 to 570 TVL (television lines).
