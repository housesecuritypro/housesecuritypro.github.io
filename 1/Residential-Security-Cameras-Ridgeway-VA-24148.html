<p>Let us know if you're thinking about adding a security system, video camera, or anything else to your home to help you stay safe. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. Instead, build your own system from an extensive equipment lineup, which includes intrusion protection, environmental monitoring, security cameras and smart home devices Vivint's alarm panel doubles as a smart home hub, so it's compatible with home automation devices from other manufacturers as well.</p>

The circuit and sensors alarm system are monitored by the control panel - the computer that arms the security system and detects breaks in the electric circuit.</p>
<p>Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
