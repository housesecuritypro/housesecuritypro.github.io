<p>If you're looking for high definition at a budget we recommend HDCVI cameras that are available at 720P and 1080P resolutions. CCTV is a television system where the signals are not publicly distributed, but are primarily for surveillance and security purposes internally. As long as the magnetic field remains balanced with the door firmly closed, the contacts within the switch would be in no-alarm condition.</p>
<p>In particular, CCTV allows greater flexibility in the deployment of security personnel by providing the facility whereby a single observer can remotely monitor several areas from one location. Under the project, the ACST would hire the services of BSNL, which will install 300 CCTV cameras at over 100 important locations across the city, including the entry-exit points, malls, sensitive areas, railway stations, bus stops and airports.</p>
