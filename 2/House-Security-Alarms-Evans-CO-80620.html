Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>Your alarm system sounds when one of your sensors is triggered or you manually set off the alarm through your control panel or key fob remote. There's a month's subscription to the video recording service so you can see whether you'd consider it worth paying for access to stored security footage. Here is an approximate price list of CCTV cameras. There are many standards of CODEC, those used for video compression that you may come across are MPEG-2, MPEG-4, JPEG 2000, AVI and H.264 , H.264 is the latest codec being introduced into the CCTV market, deriving from video conferencing equipment.</p>
