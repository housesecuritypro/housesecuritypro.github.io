<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. Displays upto 16 cameras (from different locations) on a screen at the same time with 18 zoom, 360° pan and 90 tilt features. Thermography Bullet Cameras feature temperature measurement with a range of -20°C to 550°C (-4°F to 1,022°F) with an accuracy of ±2°C, or ±2%.

Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. Usually, these cameras have a resolution in the range of 330 to 380 TVL.</p>
<p>Some systems are dedicated to one mission; others handle fire, intrusion, and safety alarms simultaneously. Like most modern technology, home security systems have evolved and improved over time. Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensors protect space by 'looking' for changes in infrared (heat) energy levels caused by movement of an intruder. Keep an eye on with what you care about at any time from anywhere; just like a security camera.</p>
