<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given.
