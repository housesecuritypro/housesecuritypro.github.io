<p>Many ADT installation packages roll together equipment fees with professional installation. Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage.

<p>It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing. ADT now offers a full DIY home security system called Blue by ADT Blue by ADT is the result of ADT's acquisition and merger with LifeShield.

<p>Suggestions include rotating personnel every 2 h, limit TV monitors to fewer than 10, arrange monitors in a curved configuration in front of the viewer, control the lighting over the console to avoid glare on the monitor screens or tilt the monitors if necessary, place the monitors in an order that permits easy recognition of camera locations, provide a swivel chair that hampers the opportunity for sleeping, and assign tasks to the viewer (e.g., communications and logging).</p>
