<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given.

Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>

<p>In accordance with the invention, a burglar alarm of an automotive vehicle having an electrical system including a battery, battery cables, at least one electrical device for drawing current from the battery, a switch for controlling current flow from the battery to the device and the charging means for supplying charging current to the battery, comprises a direct current coupled input means for providing a voltage directly proportional to the amount of current interchanged between the battery and the electrical system of the automobile; an arming means responsive to the voltage for arming said burglar alarm only when less than a first predetermined current is interchanged between the battery and the electrical system; and an alarm means for producing an alarm when the alarm is armed and more than a second predetermined amount of current is drawn from said battery.</p>
