This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>

<p>Nest thoughtfully designs its equipment and packages too; it includes two key fobs with every security equipment package—that's normally an add-on. It's professionally installed, it will look good in your house, and it supports a ton of smart home devices. The Eufy Security app also offers the ability to set activity zones, so you can draw a box on the screen to specify the area you're interested in. This is vital if you have a camera that overlooks a busy road, for example.</p>
<p>The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
