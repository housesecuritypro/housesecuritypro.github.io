<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and use — but not quite as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. AxxonSoft is a leading developer of Video Management and Physical Security Information Management software. However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system. The home security market offers many plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to deter intruders who trigger a door or window sensor. In areas of cellular communication, the SAT130 can provide high-speed IP communications to IP cameras for streaming video, video and image files.</p>
<p>A nice geofencing feature comes built with the camera, which automatically arms or disarms the monitoring system. Qumulo scales via Ethernet attached storage and processor nodes, which is ideal for integration with video management solutions. Plus, if you sign up for premium service, you get a lifetime equipment warranty on all that cool gear. The special application cameras have a gamut of uses such as in defence establishments, underwater surveillance, and other covert operations.</p>
