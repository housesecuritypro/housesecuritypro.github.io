Nexsan E-Series systems are dense storage capacity platforms that can provide the network and storage performance necessary to handle hundreds and thousands of high-definition digital video surveillance streams without dropping frames - crucial for analytics and evidentiary acceptance.</p>
<p>Installation of CCTV cameras helps not only to prevent crimes due to visual control but also to charge criminals using the information recorded by video camera. IP security cameras send their signals over a network, allowing greater information transfer than an analog signal sent to a digital video recorder (DVR).

<p>The Government of Telangana, in order to deal with safety and security issues in the capital city of Hyderabad, the Police Department initiated various projects such as City Wide Safe City Project, Community CCTV project, and ‘Nenu Saitham' project Through these projects, the police encourage individuals, residential and business communities to install CCTV cameras in perimeters, lobbies, common area, corridors, entrances, and exits and also cover around 50 metres of the building's premises.</p>
<p>Since the systems compared here are all installed by the company or another professional installer, all you need to do is open the door to let them in and pay the bill.
