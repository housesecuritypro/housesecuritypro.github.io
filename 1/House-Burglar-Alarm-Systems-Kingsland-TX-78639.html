<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. If you have a change of heart you can add their monitoring service. Most home security alarm installers can provide all-inclusive services that include equipment plus the installation and monitoring service. The chief minister had also said that a proposal to the increase the number of the CCTV cameras is likely to be cleared this month. CCTV systems are not cheap, and need to be carefully designed by specialist CCTV engineers who will ensure that the necessary standard of reliability is obtained by proper planning and specification of the type, quality and installation of the equipment.</p>
<p>Environments with more stringent security requirements (for example, schools, public buildings, and airports) rely on 24×7 video streams with higher resolution, and more frames per second to better identify suspicious persons and activity. Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>
<p>Wired security cameras use cables to transmit footage and conduct video surveillance, but the signal can weaken when the transmission range exceeds 300 meters.
