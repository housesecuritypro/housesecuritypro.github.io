<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>We really enjoyed using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier package comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure. Such a device is similar in functionality to a PC with a capture card and appropriate video recording software Unlike PCs, most DVRs designed for CCTV purposes are embedded devices that require less maintenance and simpler setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.</p>
<p>Many home security companies offer monitoring services with free or discounted equipment as long as you have a monitoring contract. When a customer calls East Texas Alarm, they speak with an actual East Texas Alarm employee directly about their monitoring and service needs.
