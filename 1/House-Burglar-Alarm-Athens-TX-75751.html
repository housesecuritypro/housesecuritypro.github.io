<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Athens</h3>
<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply only to NVR systems, but they cut out other components that would be necessary for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cables used to connect cameras to the DVR. Simply link the camera via the Nest app's Home & Away feature and it will automatically turn on when you set the Nest Thermostat to Away and off when you set it to Home.</p>
<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
