This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
