<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. That's why we recommend a camera of some kind with your DIY security system. But Atos, EMC and local security providers, such as Chubb in the UK, have come together to deliver the only end-to-end Managed Digital Video Surveillance service spanning consult, design, build and operate. When a door or window is closed, the two parts of the sensor are joined together, creating a security circuit.</p>
<p>In modern digital cameras the video image is already in a digital form - ready for processing. Remote temperature monitoring systems help you keep an eye on your property, so you can intervene as soon as issues occur. Nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensor that will trigger the camera to record video when motion is detected. The specialty of these cameras is that they capture video at 2 MP resolutions.</p>
<p>All Blue by ADT equipment and services are compatible with LifeShield systems. Some DIY systems are self-monitored, which means you'll receive alerts when devices are triggered, but it's up to you to contact the local authorities if there's a break-in or a fire. Our data management solutions excel in both, helping you to reduce storage costs and network strain without compromising the video quality you rely on for effective security.</p>

<p>Most apps also allow you to do things like view live and recorded video, lock and unlock doors, change thermostat settings, and silence alarms.

Included in the package are 3 long-lasting, fast-charging rechargeable lithium ion batteries that will take the cost out of uninterrupted monitoring, since you can easily swap them out and power up in seconds without having your cameras offline.</p>
