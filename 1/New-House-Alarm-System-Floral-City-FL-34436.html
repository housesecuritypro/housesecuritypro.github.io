<p>IP Camera Systems are used in Remote Video Surveillance. CCTV cameras in use at a baggage screening checkpoint, where the purpose of the camera is to deter theft of items within a passenger's bag, may need a high enough resolution to identify objects within a piece of luggage for it to be admissible as evidence in a court of law.

<p>At the same time, placing CCTV cameras within such locations not only cuts the risk of having someone physically watch over such dangerous areas, but also allow you to see the place in real-time. It is of note that some garage operators do not locate cameras in parking garages and lots due to the concern that doing so may expose the company to liability unless there is adequate staff to monitor the images.</p>
