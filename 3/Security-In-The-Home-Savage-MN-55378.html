<p>Eurovigil Security Solution, considered as India's most advanced electronic security system, is a part of the Eureka Forbes family. You have CCTV cameras coming with range as long as 25 to 30 metres as well. In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. The amount of digital images captured on a DVR is determined by a few factors including the frames per second recorded, the amount of cameras hooked up to the DVR device, the resolution that the DVR saves the images at, and the video compression used (e.g. MPEG4).</p>
<p>Cameras equipped with CCTVs are not only easy to maintain and conspicuous in their absence from the public eye but are also much more cost-effective than many other security solutions. But the company gives you some extra perks if you stick with them, including a lifetime warranty on all equipment as long as you're subscribed to monitoring services. For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered.</p>
<p>Video transmission is the means of getting the video signal from the camera to the recording or monitoring device. This kit also includes a separate keypad, contact sensor for doors or windows, motion detector, and a Z-Wave range extender so that you have the flexibility to place the base station as far from the other sensors as necessary. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equal.</p>
