You don't need to have an expert knowledge of CCTV systems, just a helpful and willing support staff that's more than happy to assist you with anything you may need.</p>
<p>They also include door and window sensors, remotes and an alarm that will sound when triggered to ward off intruders.

CCTV Digital video recorders have various settings to enable more video information to be recorded at the required times using technology such as video motion detection, this means that the images from the cctv cameras are only recorded when the information of the image changes, for example a person walking in front of the cctv camera.</p>
