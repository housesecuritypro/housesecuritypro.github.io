<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. The global video surveillance market was valued at $42.94 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $144.85 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2027. A key-operated switch in the sounder circuit allows you to turn the alarm system completely off when it is not needed. When the lights are switched ON, the intruder feels that he has been detected and the owner is trying to confirm this.</p>
<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>
