Many providers offer smart home devices and or integration features that you can purchase as part of a security system package or as a standalone product.

The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. Instead, build your own system from an extensive equipment lineup, which includes intrusion protection, environmental monitoring, security cameras and smart home devices Vivint's alarm panel doubles as a smart home hub, so it's compatible with home automation devices from other manufacturers as well.</p>
