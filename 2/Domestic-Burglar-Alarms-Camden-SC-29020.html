<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. And sometimes, motion sensors can do the job of several entry sensors. This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Iota kit comes with a fun three-in-one Iota hub: security hub, motion detector, and camera, all rolled into a single device. Video analytics enhances video surveillance systems by performing the tasks of real-time event detection, post-event analysis, and extraction of statistical data while saving manpower costs and increasing the effectiveness of the surveillance system operation.</p>
<p>Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>

In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm.</p>

The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future.</p>
