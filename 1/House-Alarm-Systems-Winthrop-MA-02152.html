We have many General Purpose Sensors on our website that can monitor such conditions as indoor or outdoor temperature, wind, rain or freezing, indoor or outdoor motion, door or window opening, smoke, and even water leaks from your toilet, water heater, or any other appliance.</p>

It's well worth investing time in researching home security systems in order to gain peace of mind knowing that you've chosen the right system to protect your home and family.
