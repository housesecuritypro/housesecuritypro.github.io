<p>Factors we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>If all the alarms have the same rate of failing to detect when one is present - then getting the best system that is least likely to falsely report the presence of an intruder is the optimum route to take.
