The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.</p>
<p>Factors we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>Since the systems compared here are all installed by the company or another professional installer, all you need to do is open the door to let them in and pay the bill. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction.
