In the last couple of years, the company started offering additional security solutions like modern, easy-to-use equipment, which integrate well and offers smart home compatibility.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>There are a variety of sensor options available, including contact sensors for doors and windows when they're opened or closed, motion sensors for indoor and outdoor movement detection, garage door tilt sensors, and glass break sensors.

When this occurs, the output of flip-flop 72, which is provided to the enable input of an entry delay timer 86, causes entry delay timer 86 to begin an entry delay interval.</p>
