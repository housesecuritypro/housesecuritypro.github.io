<p>HYDERABAD: Since the formation of Telangana State, CCTV cameras have become an essential part of policing. Nearly 100,000^ burglaries happen at an address that has been burgled before, new figures obtained by security company ADT and independent charity Victim Support reveal. Most of the burglar alarms today employ sirens that are wired into the home's electrical source.</p>
