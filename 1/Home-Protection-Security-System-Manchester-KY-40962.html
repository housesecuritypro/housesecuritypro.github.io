<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips. There are three types of cameras based on lighting and resolution. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>All images and video clips recorded with a Vivint surveillance system are automatically transferred via your home's Wi-Fi network to Vivint Smart Drive cloud storage. On the other hand, the best self-installed systems like Frontpoint and SimpliSafe come directly to your door pre-programmed and ready to go. These systems may not have as many bells and whistles as their professionally installed counterparts, but they're great for smaller homes that need the basics.</p>
