Municipal fees for alarm permits: Some cities charge a yearly permit fee, usually $30 to $50, for local police to respond to emergency calls triggered by monitored home security systems.</p>

Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>
