Some alarm systems use real-time audio and video monitoring technology to verify the legitimacy of an alarm. CCTV Security Pros offers the widest selection of advanced functionality for one location or multi-location business surveillance systems.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>The cameras are pretty basic and bulky compared to other offerings out there at the same (or lower) pricepoint.
