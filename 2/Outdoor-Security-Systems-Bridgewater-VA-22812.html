<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want. Monitoring for professionally installed systems tends to be more expensive.</p>
<p>The appropriate areas for proper placement of cameras can be entrances, hallways, driveways, T- Points, highway intersection points, exits, etc., and in areas where there is a high density of people or vehicles. Snapdeal is a place which allows you a wide range of CCTV camera types and that too at cost-effective prices. Smart home-security systems connect to your smartphone or tablet, or those of family members.</p>

Sadly, you cannot download the videos to your phone and you need to physically remove the micro SD card from the camera to store the feeds or make use of network storage to automate it. Xiaomi should think of this as an option for users to store the footage on their smartphones and update the app accordingly.</p>
