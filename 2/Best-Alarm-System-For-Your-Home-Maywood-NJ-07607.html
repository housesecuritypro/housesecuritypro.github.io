<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms.

A DVR combines and enhances the recording capabilities of a time lapse VCR and a multiplexer. Once installed, the Frontpoint Security system is fairly easy to navigate, and there is a convenient remote-control app for this system that's compatible with both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>However, combined with the compatible locks, alarms, webcams and sensors, you can create a seriously secure home. It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular.
