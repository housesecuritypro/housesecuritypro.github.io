<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. The price of professional monitoring will vary based on the equipment you choose. CCTV cameras can be placed in a location of your own choosing, and do not require extensive modifications to your existing infrastructure.</p>
