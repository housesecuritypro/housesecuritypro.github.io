<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. When there is a requirement for recording more than one cctv camera and video switcher can be used, the cameras are connected into the switcher and the switcher will automatically switch the image being fed to the monitor and the video. Your ADT smart security technician can help ensure you're getting the right solution for your needs, and help set up your system so it's ready to go.</p>
<p>From something as simple as a smart outlet that lets you turn lights on and off remotely to more sophisticated equipment like a smart doorbell, it all boils down to what makes your life easier and safer. I am no expert but it sounds to me like the video time has been manipulated.
