Thermography Bullet Cameras feature temperature measurement with a range of -20°C to 550°C (-4°F to 1,022°F) with an accuracy of ±2°C, or ±2%.

<p>Fort Knox® has worked hard to gain a good reputation with our Houston customers as a company with low rates and quick response times, thanks to our technicians with 20+ years of experience, and our company-owned monitoring center.

<h2>Home Security System Packages in Spring Branch Texas</h2>

<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
