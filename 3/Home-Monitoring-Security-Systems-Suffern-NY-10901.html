<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>A shift from analog to IP technologies, cloud solutions for storage, and rise of video surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) present new, untapped opportunities for security solution providers. The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on. Both can also be included in a Nest Aware package to record and store all video automatically to the cloud.</p>

Abode is one of the best security companies that lets you monitor activity for free: All features of their mobile app are available without paid service Long-term and very short-term contracts are available too. Now, most security systems involve a great number of components, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, among other components.</p>

<p>Additionally, many home security companies charge high cancellation fees if you terminate a monitoring agreement before you pay for your equipment in full. Video surveillance is an important application that utilizes shared storage resources. Often, local municipalities require home security alarm permits These permits are said to help reduce the number of false alarms so that emergency services aren't unnecessarily taxed.</p>

<p>These cameras are extremely useful in defence locations, in border areas, and other places where you need 24X7 surveillance activities. Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available.

The SimpliSafe app lets you control your SimpliSafe security system from anywhere in the world. It quickly became our favorite camera in the house, and we kept coming back to it even though we had several others up and running at the same time.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>
