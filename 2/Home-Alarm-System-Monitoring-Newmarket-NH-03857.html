Broadband security systems connect to the professional monitoring center through your home's internet connection. A monitoring professional will contact you within 24 hours to discuss your home security needs. It is also important to understand that although CCTV cameras are primarily installed for video surveillance and to discourage thieves and other criminal activity, they can also help to improve the efficiency and productivity level of your employees.</p>
<p>Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about. With our CCTV cameras, you will now be able to detect any changes in behaviour, however insignificant. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
<p>Video doorbells offer an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get close to the door. You'll also be able to monitor the video being recorded through the app, go through previously recorded footage, and check environmental markers like temperature.
