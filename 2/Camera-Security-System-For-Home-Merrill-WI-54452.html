While not an essential requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a variety of camera options as add-ons. For smart home features, we recommend the ADT Pulse package. ADT is one of the more expensive home security companies, with high-priced video monitoring and steep early termination fees.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. There are plenty of affordable cameras available that offer good video performance, but as with just about any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power.</p>
<p>We believe the best way to secure your home is with the extra protection of professional monitoring. You can find two types of security systems: professionally monitored and unmonitored.

Remote Control: Instead of using the keypad to deactivate your alarm, some systems come with a remote control.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. This indicates vast scope for use of more CCTV cameras by organisations in India. Many intruder alarm systems make use of a PIR or passive infra red sensor as a motion detector.
