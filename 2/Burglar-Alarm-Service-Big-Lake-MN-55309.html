Monitoring is a bargain compared to traditional home security companies, but remember that Ring's first focus is smart home products, not security service.</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. They do not and cannot monitor security cameras.

<p>Only 5G can support the increasing density of cameras, with the uplink bandwidth and quality of service that 4K and 8K video require.
