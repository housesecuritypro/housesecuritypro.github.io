<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>

Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. The joint AxxonSoft video management software with its intelligent technologies and NetApp® E-Series storage solution provide superior performance and highly reliable storage to meet the advances of next-generation video surveillance and analytics requirements.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras system recorders: DVR (digital video recorder) which record onto hard drives is the best option. For doors and windows switches are provided which are open as long as the door or window is closed, but which, on being released by opening the door or windows, automatically close the circuit.
