<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. The global video surveillance market was valued at $42.94 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $144.85 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2027. A key-operated switch in the sounder circuit allows you to turn the alarm system completely off when it is not needed. When the lights are switched ON, the intruder feels that he has been detected and the owner is trying to confirm this.</p>
<p>It's built around the Nest Secure alarm system, so it's no surprise that it integrates with Google Assistant, which allows you to control the system with your voice.

Big investments by the likes of Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have made home security cameras more prominent.</p>

<p>Covert CCTV is the practice of using video cameras in locations that are not made obvious to the persons being monitored in the specific cctv camera coverage area, but it is recommended that there is reasonable cause for the purpose of covert surveillance and that its primary objectives are clearly noted, only used for the purposes of preventing crime and are not used for longer than intended.</p>
