<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want. Monitoring for professionally installed systems tends to be more expensive.</p>
<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that captures video at 720p will usually offer a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video offers more detail and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it doesn't require lots of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>
<p>Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording. It lets you arm and disarm your home security system, control smart devices and check in on your home - from virtually anywhere. Turn off lights, lock doors and arm your security system with a single phrase or control panel touchscreen tap. We will continue to challenge ourselves to exceed our customers' expectations by employing industry proven best practices, hiring professionals in the field, reinvesting in our infrastructure and state of the art technology, and constantly improving our monitoring processes.</p>

Typically, a CCTV security system with 4 dome cameras, 4 channel DVR with 1 TB hard disk costs around 15k to 20k depending on factors like where are you living, CCTV and the length of wire.

<p>In Wireless Systems , the principle is the same except no wires are required to connect the sensor to the Control Unit. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone.

Wired or wireless, these cameras offer wide coverage and 720p resolution. Some other cheap security systems , like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with smart home devices like lights and locks.</p>
<p>Technology has come such a long way that DIY systems can offer the same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. From a homeowners' point of view, you'll need to know whether you want a basic system, or one with more technologically advanced bells and whistles, such as home automation, smart home integration, and so on. Prices, monthly monitoring costs, and lengths of contracts can vary widely among various home security systems in the marketplace.</p>
