<p>Take charge of your home security with a CCTV surveillance system that is discreet, high-powered, and built to last. Archive footage is stored on network video recorders (NVRs) or on secure software for later access. They will also know how to maintain their own systems and prevent or lessen false alarms. In that time, we have built a reputation of honesty and professionalism in both the community and in the judicial system.</p>

The price of professional monitoring will vary based on the equipment you choose. CCTV cameras can be placed in a location of your own choosing, and do not require extensive modifications to your existing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Sometimes that means a human watching live footage, usually from multiple video feeds. If this happens, call your current monitoring company to confirm. But the industry is still dominated by outdated analogue-based surveillance systems that occupy a lion's share of about 68 per cent in the market. Experts studying how the camera systems in Britain are operated have also found that the mostly male (and probably bored) operators frequently use the cameras to voyeuristically spy on women.</p>
