Network video servers are designed for IP CCTV cameras over WAN or LAN computer networks where each camera has its own unique IP address. Many people don't realize how easy and convenient it can be to control their alarm system from their phone.</p>
<p>That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. By using the latest technology and our years of expertise in high-speed video capture, we have built a portfolio of products designed for surveillance, physical security, and smart buildings.
