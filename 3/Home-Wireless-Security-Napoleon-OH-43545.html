<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at.

<p>While it is a fairly simple indoor-only camera, the SimpliCam received the highest ratings for overall satisfaction (8.5), satisfaction with reliability (8.7), and satisfaction with smartphone and tablet control (8.7). Only 7 percent of SimpliSafe respondents said they needed to contact technical support over the last year, the lowest percentage among all brands rated.</p>
