<p>When triggered, EZVIZ cameras capture and send images to you along with alarm notifications via the EZVIZ app. FYI: Some professionally installed home security brands offer some type of move for free” deal, where they will reinstall your system in your new place free of charge. However, with a professional installation, you might have to wait a week or more for the next available installation appointment.</p>
<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party.
