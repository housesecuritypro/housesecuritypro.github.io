<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Blue by ADT offers the best of both worlds—easy DIY home security backed by trustworthy professional monitoring from ADT. Simply closing the door or window, moreover, does not restore the switch loop circuit continuity and does not stop the sound until either the battery becomes exhausted or someone switches off the circuit from battery to sounder. With a few well-placed ADT outdoor security cameras, you'll know.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe also offers a smart video doorbell with two-way audio that integrates with the SimpliSafe system; you can back up and store video recordings from its camera as part of the monthly Interactive plan as well.

<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
