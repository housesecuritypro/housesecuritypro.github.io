<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>DIY monitoring is always available with the free SimpliSafe mobile app. Many security cameras have infrared (IR) light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light. However, in terms of market share, the commercial sector dominates the global CCTV camera market The commercial segment is expected to reach a market size of over US$ 13,100 Mn by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>A pair of input leads, each lead being for connection to one of two spaced apart points of the electrical system, said points being selected to produce a detectable voltage between said input leads when current is drawn from said battery by said at least one device.

<p>It the ray of light was broken, if even for a moment, the current stopped flowing and an alarm sounded. ADT Control is compatible with more smart home devices including Amazon Alexa and video doorbell cameras. Create schedules for your security system and smart devices to perform actions at certain times, or in response to specific circumstances. Sadly, you cannot download the videos to your phone and you need to physically remove the micro SD card from the camera to store the feeds or make use of network storage to automate it. Xiaomi should think of this as an option for users to store the footage on their smartphones and update the app accordingly.</p>
