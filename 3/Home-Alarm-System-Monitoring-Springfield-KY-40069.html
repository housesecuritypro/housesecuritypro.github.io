<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. It sounds fancy and sophisticated, but Remote Control is a home security feature that comes with many affordable systems. And some security cameras, like Reolink Argus 2 , have an SD card slot, which allows you to have the option to put into your own Micro SD card for motion event recording.
