The best DIY home security systems are pre-configured at the factory and ready to perform right out-of-the-box. Images from the CCTV cameras would be transmitted through 3G broadband network to the police control room, from where, monitoring would be done,” the Police Commissioner said.</p>
<p>At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed. Home Value Monitoring is free, and it only takes a minute to set up.
