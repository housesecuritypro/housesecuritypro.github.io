<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>

Once everything is set up and the server connection is established—you'll get the blue light on the notification LED on the Akita—the app will list out all the smart devices on your network. Network Cameras are professional solutions with high definition and stable imaging designed for a wide range of video surveillance applications.</p>
