As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest.

<p>We have discussed various aspects of CCTV cameras and security systems. Most insurers will insist on a minimum level of security before they will offer you insurance, such as deadlocks on some or all external doors. The theory behind burglar alarms as deterrents is that, by merely seeing a burglar alarm, potential burglars will be put off. With the technology offered by professional security providers, you can use your phone, tablet or laptop to check in on your house.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera has an impressive motion detection feature. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY option. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to control almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly customizable.</p>
<p>We still recommend SimpliSafe overall because it has a wider range of equipment and better cameras.
