You have CCTV cameras coming with range as long as 25 to 30 metres as well. In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. The amount of digital images captured on a DVR is determined by a few factors including the frames per second recorded, the amount of cameras hooked up to the DVR device, the resolution that the DVR saves the images at, and the video compression used (e.g. MPEG4).</p>
<p>Modern technology has made it possible to access the videos from these CCTV security systems live on phones. AxxonSoft's intelligent VMS software powered by Huawei's outstanding computing solutions maximizes public and business security. If something triggers your alarm, you can check your cameras to see what set it off.

Most of the sensors detect opening of a door, window or breakage of glass or movement of human beings. Then, when the light beam is intercepted, the grid voltage is permitted to go to a high negative value, thereby cutting off the plate current and operating the alarm or indicator relay.</p>

Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>
