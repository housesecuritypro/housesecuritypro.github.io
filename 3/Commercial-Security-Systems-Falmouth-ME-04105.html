Included in the package are 3 long-lasting, fast-charging rechargeable lithium ion batteries that will take the cost out of uninterrupted monitoring, since you can easily swap them out and power up in seconds without having your cameras offline.</p>
<p>For controlling and output for monitoring. When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>You can't be in two places at once, but you can view cameras at different locations of your businesses and check in when you can't be there. A new breed of CCTV cameras referred to as IP CCTV Cameras (Internet Protocol Closed Circuit TeleVision) uses a data signal which comprises of a series of computer readable still images.

The following chart depicts the number of CCTV cameras available with the police as on the first of January of each year.</p>
<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party.

Therefore, the wireless control over smart home devices increases the consumers' likelihood of purchasing these devices.</p>
