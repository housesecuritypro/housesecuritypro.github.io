<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
