<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>

You don't have to look far into the future to see a time when all houses come equipped with home security cameras. The magnet part of the device is screwed to a door or window, and the switch part is screwed to the door or window frame.</p>
<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
<p>By leveraging existing video surveillance infrastructure, video analytics are a highly cost-effective means to augment security with new detection capabilities, reduce staffing requirements by directing attention to key events, automate access control and other facility functions, and collect data on customer behavior.

<p>Edge Storage is the recording of video and storing it at the camera instead of - or in redundancy with - a centralized recording facility across the network. For an extra layer of security, look for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they're out of range of the camera lens and the motion sensor. The blending of IoT devices and smart objects with video surveillance systems will be also a key to providing the next generation of security and surveillance functionalities.</p>
