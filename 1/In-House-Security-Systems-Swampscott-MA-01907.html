<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>
<p>Cameras equipped with CCTVs are not only easy to maintain and conspicuous in their absence from the public eye but are also much more cost-effective than many other security solutions. But the company gives you some extra perks if you stick with them, including a lifetime warranty on all equipment as long as you're subscribed to monitoring services. For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered.</p>

It lets you arm and disarm your home security system, control smart devices and check in on your home - from virtually anywhere.
