The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify. With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring includes a team of specialists available around-the-clock for emergencies. Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees.</p>
