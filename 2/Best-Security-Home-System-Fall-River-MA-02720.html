<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>If you're looking for high definition at a budget we recommend HDCVI cameras that are available at 720P and 1080P resolutions.

Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Many video surveillance systems are integrated” into the protection system and designed to only capture (record) images to be utilized later if necessary. You can typically expect to pay two separate costs: the price of your equipment and monthly professional monitoring.
