Security functions are performed in the most efficient way with the help of motion detectors on video cameras and intrusion detection sensors. Home security equipment:: Home8 security packages are more than just a camera or a keypad. You would need to install multiple cameras to view a larger area. Wireless cameras that you can attach to your wall can do all the dirty work, but if you have a bigger area to cover up you maybe want another type.</p>
<p>DVRs evolved from the older VCR models, while NVRs represent the next step in the evolution of video recording technology.

<p>You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. The advent of 360o cameras equipped with video de-warping technology is eliminating the need to deploy 3 to 4 PTZ (or the standard CCTV) cameras to cover a single region, as a single device can now effectively do the same.

<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems.

Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>
