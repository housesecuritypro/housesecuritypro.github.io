<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Additional sensors can also be added at a fairly low cost, like a $70 smoke detector, additional motion detectors for $40 and a $120 camera that can be used indoors or outside. It's well worth investing time in researching home security systems in order to gain peace of mind knowing that you've chosen the right system to protect your home and family. Do I really need a home security system - while most people think of home security systems as a way to protect their homes from burglaries, what many people may not realize is that these systems can also protect homes from fires as well - a must, literally, to have a home security camera system.</p>
