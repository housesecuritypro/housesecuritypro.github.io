<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>DIY monitoring is always available with the free SimpliSafe mobile app. Many security cameras have infrared (IR) light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light. However, in terms of market share, the commercial sector dominates the global CCTV camera market The commercial segment is expected to reach a market size of over US$ 13,100 Mn by the end of 2025.</p>

The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service.
