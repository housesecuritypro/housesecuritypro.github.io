<p>Positions for camera installation: Cameras should be placed in appropriate areas to record relevant video.

<p>Edge Storage is the recording of video and storing it at the camera instead of - or in redundancy with - a centralized recording facility across the network. For an extra layer of security, look for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they're out of range of the camera lens and the motion sensor. The blending of IoT devices and smart objects with video surveillance systems will be also a key to providing the next generation of security and surveillance functionalities.</p>
