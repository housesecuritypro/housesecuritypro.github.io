In recent times, surveillance systems are gaining a lot of popularity. These security systems have helped the police department solved countless cases of theft and other criminal activity. Since IP cameras have a wider field of vision, as well, an IP system can often work with fewer less cameras than an analog system.</p>
<p>With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>
<p>5G supports a flexible, distributed cloud for local video management and data privacy. Basic home security equipment includes window and door sensors, door locks and a central panel or base hub that arms and disarms the alarm system.
