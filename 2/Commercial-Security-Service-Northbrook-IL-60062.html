<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? We would like to appreciate the service provided by EFL for the prompt information given by your Eurovigil Monitoring Station in calling us immediately when there was a burglary attempt at our office thereby preventing any loss.

<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>
<p>Send a clear message that ADT and our alarm systems are there to help protect your home and keep you and your family safer. As a substitute, you can put a motion sensor in every room, and then if anybody attempts to get in via the window, an alarm will be transmitted to the control panel.
