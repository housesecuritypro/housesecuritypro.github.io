<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>

When the circuit is switched ‘on' the transistor drives the laser torch so that it produces the light waves corresponding to the frequency.</p>

<p>DIY systems are typically easy to install, but you'll have to give some thought as to the placement of the hub, sensors, and security cameras.

<p>The Washington Post reported in February 2014 that new aerial video surveillance technologies are being deployed that can monitor virtually everything in an area the size of a small city. The video information recorded is limited by the amount of cctv cameras on the system and the length of time the VCR is set to record for.
