A physical attack could be accompanied by a cyber attack on the video surveillance infrastructure, as a means of compromising the ability of the latter to detect the physical security incident.</p>

The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>
