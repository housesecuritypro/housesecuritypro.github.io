While the company doesn't offer quite as many hours of customer support as other brands, it has a fantastic reputation with lots of vocal, happy customers. Professional monitoring by Abode adds emergency dispatch service and keeps a 90-day log of system activity.</p>
<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable. The main features of these security cameras are its high resolution and scalability. Operational surveillance requirements mean a higher number of deployed cameras - ranging from tens to thousands - with higher digital resolutions that in-turn drive increased networking bandwidth, storage performance and the capacity to retain recordings for months.</p>
