<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want.

Numerous studies show homes without security systems, when compared to those with professionally monitored systems, are up to three times more likely to be burglarized because burglars are opportunistic by nature and are on the hunt for easy targets.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation â€” well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>

Some home security providers offer both DIY and professional installation, while others only provide one option. Brinks equipment options include basic home security or home security with video, and the alarm panel is also a smart home hub compatible with Z-wave and Alexa devices.</p>
<p>Yes, some home security systems with low overall costs will have upfront equipment costs.

Some cameras can have filters installed that allow better resolution in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips. There are three types of cameras based on lighting and resolution.
