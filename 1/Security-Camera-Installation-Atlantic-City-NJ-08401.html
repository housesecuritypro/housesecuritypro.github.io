The $39.99 monthly service is for a basic alarm system only, while adding a camera or doorbell adds another $5 a month.</p>
<p>Video transmission is the means of getting the video signal from the camera to the recording or monitoring device. This kit also includes a separate keypad, contact sensor for doors or windows, motion detector, and a Z-Wave range extender so that you have the flexibility to place the base station as far from the other sensors as necessary. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equal.</p>
