<p>Motion detection: Assuming you're monitoring your home when it's empty, motion detection is one of the most desirable features in a security camera. When an alarm is triggered, trained professionals take the appropriate action: alerting your emergency contacts, dispatching Guard Response (where available) to verify intrusion alarms, and alerting the appropriate responders - e.g. police, fire dept, ambulance - if an emergency is confirmed.</p>
<p>These types of camera systems allow you to stream video to your smartphone, tablet or desktop computer; and will even send you notifications if they detect motion. While having the monitoring data from RPA's Passive House projects will be very useful, it will be even more valuable to aggregate the data from all PHIUS certified Passive House projects into a single repository so we can compare information across climate zones furthering the climate adaptive standards.</p>
<p>The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
