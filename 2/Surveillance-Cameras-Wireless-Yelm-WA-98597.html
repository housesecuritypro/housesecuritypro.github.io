<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. And now that the best systems are affordable, functional, and easy to use, there's really no reason not to find a security system that works for your budget and lifestyle.

Once everything is set up and the server connection is established—you'll get the blue light on the notification LED on the Akita—the app will list out all the smart devices on your network. Network Cameras are professional solutions with high definition and stable imaging designed for a wide range of video surveillance applications.</p>
