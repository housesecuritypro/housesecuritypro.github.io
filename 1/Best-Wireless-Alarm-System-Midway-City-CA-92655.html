<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Outdoor security cameras can present more of a challenge, especially if the home's exterior has limited power sources, if you don't have many tools or if you are concerned about affecting your home's appearance. ADT Go is an app that helps provide peace of mind and reliable ADT emergency monitoring wherever you may go. Simply hold down the SOS button during an emergency and ADT will be notified and will alert emergency responders if you're not okay.</p>
<p>Nest also offers professional monitoring through Brinks home security for $29 per month, which provides additional security by continuing to monitor even if you lose internet or power.
