A burglar alarm system consists of a series of electrical components that are connected to a property.</p>
<p>The integration of different devices, with varying levels of compatibilities, on a single platform, is the major design issue with security systems. The structure of the global CCTV Camera market report takes a systematic approach. Small Wi-Fi home security cameras (also called IP cameras) have dominated the market in 2016.
