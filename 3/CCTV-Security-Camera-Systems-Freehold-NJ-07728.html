<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? We would like to appreciate the service provided by EFL for the prompt information given by your Eurovigil Monitoring Station in calling us immediately when there was a burglary attempt at our office thereby preventing any loss. This principle works in the same way with burglar alarms. The cameras and thermal imaging systems need to be connected for real-time uploads 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Cameras equipped with CCTVs are not only easy to maintain and conspicuous in their absence from the public eye but are also much more cost-effective than many other security solutions.

For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered.</p>
