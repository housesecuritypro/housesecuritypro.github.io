The smart and secured D3D Security System comes with several wireless modules like door-window sensor, PIR motion sensor, smoke leakage sensor etc.</p>
<p>As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest. If you get a burglar alarm maintenance contract, your alarm will be checked once a year (twice a year if you have a police-monitoring contract) either remotely or by an installer coming to your home.
