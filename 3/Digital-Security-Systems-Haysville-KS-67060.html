Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more widespread feature of American life.

<p>Additionally, many home security companies charge high cancellation fees if you terminate a monitoring agreement before you pay for your equipment in full. Video surveillance is an important application that utilizes shared storage resources.
