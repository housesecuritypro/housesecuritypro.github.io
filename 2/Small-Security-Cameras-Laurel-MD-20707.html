<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. Ella can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language queries, letting users search footage to find clips showing specific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, or even individual car makes and models.
