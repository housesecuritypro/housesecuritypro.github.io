Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
