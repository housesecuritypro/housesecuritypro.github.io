<p>If you want to keep an eye on what's happening in your home when you're not there, but you don't want to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look. The top security companies offer security suites that integrate a variety of features. These cameras, both hardwired and wireless, transmit images over the Internet, often compressing the bandwidth so as not to overwhelm the web.</p>
