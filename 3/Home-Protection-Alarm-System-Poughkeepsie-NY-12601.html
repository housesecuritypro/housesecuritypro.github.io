This same design is commonly used for Window Sensors, too, where a switch is placed in the window frame and a magnet in the door itself. Video surveillance systems (or CCTV) have evolved significantly in the last several years. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems.

DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need them—perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs. CCTV is different from broadcast television as all the equipment is directly connected together with cables or wireless transmitters that can not be received by standard television aerials or transmissions of the video signals are only intended to be accessible by the equipment on its dedicated closed circuit.</p>
