Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
<p>For most home systems, 1080p resolution, also called Full HD or FHD, is sufficient, but you can also pay more for 2K or 4K cameras, which have, respectively, two or four times as much resolution. The camera doesn't require extra sensors and you only have to download the dedicated app to be able to monitor your home around-the-clock, from anywhere.
