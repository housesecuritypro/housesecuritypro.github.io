<p>ADT security systems require professional installation. Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes. As you compare home security systems, it helps to understand the difference between wired or wireless systems and monitored or unmonitored alarms.

<p>Installing such cameras is easy as they require standard installing equipment such as C-clamps or S-clamps. The scopes like prevention, detection, and intervention which have led to the development of real and consistent video surveillance systems are capable of intelligent video processing competencies.
