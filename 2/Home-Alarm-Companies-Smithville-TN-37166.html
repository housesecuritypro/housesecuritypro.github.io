<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. Displays upto 16 cameras (from different locations) on a screen at the same time with 18 zoom, 360° pan and 90 tilt features. Thermography Bullet Cameras feature temperature measurement with a range of -20°C to 550°C (-4°F to 1,022°F) with an accuracy of ±2°C, or ±2%. With monitoring services starting at $8.95 per month, everyone can protect what's most precious to them.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day.
