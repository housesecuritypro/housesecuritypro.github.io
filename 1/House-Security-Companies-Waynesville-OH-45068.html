<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. However, Growing government and stakeholder funding for developing smart cities and employing city surveillance solutions, rising demand for VSaaS services, ongoing technological advancements in Big Data, IoT, and cloud-based services, and rising trends of artificial intelligence and deep learning for video surveillance systems will provide opportunities to players in the video surveillance market during the forecast period.</p>

<p>But just like Netgear, they've also ventured into digital home solutions, specifically remote home monitoring systems. An alert's processing time, or response time,‚Äù can depend on the system setup, monitoring center technology, staff training, and other factors.
