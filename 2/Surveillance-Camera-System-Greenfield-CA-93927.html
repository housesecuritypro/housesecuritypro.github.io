Because of the wireless equipment, the installation process is pretty straightforward; you just have to choose where to put the devices.

Alarm Relay is a TMA Five Diamond monitoring center. Although video motion detection and video analytics (Chapter 7) apply technology to identify anomalies that human observers may miss, security management should take action to reduce fatigue and ensure good-quality viewing.</p>
