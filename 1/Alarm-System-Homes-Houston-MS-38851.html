<p>The best in smart home security systems. It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more widespread feature of American life. Therefore, the wireless control over smart home devices increases the consumers' likelihood of purchasing these devices.</p>
<p>Base stations are the center of a security system, using WiFi and wireless technology to connect all the various sensors, cameras, and other system components. Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal.
