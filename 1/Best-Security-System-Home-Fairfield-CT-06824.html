<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>A shift from analog to IP technologies, cloud solutions for storage, and rise of video surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS) present new, untapped opportunities for security solution providers. The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on. Both can also be included in a Nest Aware package to record and store all video automatically to the cloud.</p>
<p>From your windows and doors to your garage, get a real-time look at the status of every sensor instantly with the mobile app's dashboard. Our IP-based video security solution allows you to build a future-proof security ecosystem. Includes video monitoring & real time alerts. These cameras are great for spotting misconduct and allows the user to zoom in for extra clarity, should the footage need to be used in court.</p>
