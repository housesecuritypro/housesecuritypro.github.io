Door and window sensors typically operate using a magnetic connection. At least a 720p resolution is pretty standard for home security cameras these days, but some now offer an even better resolution than that.</p>
<p>Factors we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>The surveillance system consists of a CCTV camera with the motion sensor, a power cord for the camera, a data card for internet, an alarm and an UPS for power backup. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. Protect America offers low-cost home security with flexible monitoring options. The sensor is Stick Nest Detect, which is a versatile piece of hardware, as each one can be used to secure a window, door, or even a wall, as it detects motion, with additional sensors available for $49.</p>
<p>Edge Storage is the recording of video and storing it at the camera instead of - or in redundancy with - a centralized recording facility across the network. For an extra layer of security, look for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they're out of range of the camera lens and the motion sensor. The blending of IoT devices and smart objects with video surveillance systems will be also a key to providing the next generation of security and surveillance functionalities.</p>
