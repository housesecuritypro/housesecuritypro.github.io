<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud.

Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
