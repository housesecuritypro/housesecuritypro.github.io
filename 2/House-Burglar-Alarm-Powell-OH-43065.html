This prevents a discharge resulting from an unauthorized entry into the vehicle from resetting arming timer 50. However, an engine start will cause comparator 42 to provide a logic high signal output due to charging of battery 10, thus resetting arming timer 50, and preventing an alarm from being sounded, as described below.</p>
