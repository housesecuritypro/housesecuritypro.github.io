Monitored home security systems are generally more expensive than unmonitored systems, but they have the added security benefit of connecting directly to a professional monitoring center.</p>
<p>In late 1990s, the digital cameras came into the market, they were built on Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based image sensor whose performance is better and are cheaper than Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD). While wireless CCTV cameras transmit their video images to a digital video recorder or monitor, many of these types of cameras must be plugged into an electrical outlet.</p>

<p>Nest is pricier than most other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you want to monitor your system yourself. Choose the best digital IP camera for your needs, from high definition to multi-pixel, box or dome, wired or wireless, and stationary or pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) versions.

<p>Technology has come such a long way that DIY systems can offer the same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. From a homeowners' point of view, you'll need to know whether you want a basic system, or one with more technologically advanced bells and whistles, such as home automation, smart home integration, and so on.
