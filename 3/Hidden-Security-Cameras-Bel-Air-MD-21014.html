<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that.

<p>Many home security companies offer monitoring services with free or discounted equipment as long as you have a monitoring contract.

<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again.</p>
<p>Many top security system companies may also offer environmental sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors for fire and flood detection, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors to monitor indoor air quality in real time. Alarm means for producing an alarm when said burglar alarm is armed and more than a predetermined current is drawn from said battery.</p>
