<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. By using the latest technology and our years of expertise in high-speed video capture, we have built a portfolio of products designed for surveillance, physical security, and smart buildings. Many cameras also offer a software zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens).</p>

Additionally, devices that connect via Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and smart door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network.
