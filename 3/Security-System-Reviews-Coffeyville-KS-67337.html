Certificates for both burglar and fire alarm systems.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>Just as a suggestion and maybe useful tip, if you are actually working with more than one or two cameras, you might want to set up a surveillance spot or hub, the central point or your hole security operation, you for sure will want to keep everything in one place, that will guarantee easy access and a lot of comforts when you are setting up everything.</p>
