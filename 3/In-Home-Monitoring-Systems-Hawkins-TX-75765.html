<p>The best in smart home security systems. It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more widespread feature of American life. Therefore, the wireless control over smart home devices increases the consumers' likelihood of purchasing these devices.</p>
<p>In modern digital cameras the video image is already in a digital form - ready for processing. Remote temperature monitoring systems help you keep an eye on your property, so you can intervene as soon as issues occur. Nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensor that will trigger the camera to record video when motion is detected. The specialty of these cameras is that they capture video at 2 MP resolutions.</p>

The Link Interactive system features 2-way voice on the control panel so you can speak directly to the monitoring station through your panel.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
