<p>In the event of an incident, our alarm system instantly notifies the monitoring service and authorities will be dispatched. The IP surveillance system is made up of two components—IP-based camera that records video content using a network video recorder (NVR) and video surveillance platform that captures and distributes the video content through the network.</p>
