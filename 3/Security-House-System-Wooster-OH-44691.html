<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
<p>If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should be able to provide you with the necessary information. Videos from both IP cameras and analog cameras can be transferred over the computer network whereas unlike analog cameras, IP cameras can connect directly to an IP network. In order to know about burglar alarms and how they work, one has to compare them to a simple electric circuit or appliance.</p>
<p>Wired security cameras use cables to transmit footage and conduct video surveillance, but the signal can weaken when the transmission range exceeds 300 meters.
