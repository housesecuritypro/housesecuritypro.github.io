The SAT130 has an FTP Proxy which can allow IP cameras to transfer images over the satellite link.</p>
<p>They are often connected to a recording device or IP network , and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable database , and by video analysis software (such as VIRAT and HumanID ). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected.</p>
<p>In the last few years, the video surveillance market has seen a major transformation into third generation video surveillance systems, moving to IP video from traditional analog video causing better processing power and improved compression algorithm 3 These Intelligent video surveillance systems are not just confined to laboratories but have hit the marketplace as well.</p>
<p>Network Video Recorders (NVR) and analog recorders (VCRs), also available for purchase, work the same way as a DVR, using an internet signal (NVR) or blank tapes (VCR) to record instead of a digital hard-drive.

You have different types of CCTV cameras based on the location. Acquisition and collaboration of market players is one of the key strategies followed by leading CCTV camera providers in the market.</p>
