<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>Security cameras could never just do monitoring. Infra red lighting can illuminate areas at different frequencies, although invisible to the naked eye, CCTV cameras can see the light emitted.
