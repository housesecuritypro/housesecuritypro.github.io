<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>Video Wall Controllers can manage multiple signals to deliver feeds to various LCD or LED screens. Nest got its start making smart home devices such as remote-controlled thermostats.

As with any DIY home security system that uses wireless functionality, the installation is rather simple. Apple HomeKit compatibility coming soon to all Blue cameras.</p>

CCTV cameras in use at a baggage screening checkpoint, where the purpose of the camera is to deter theft of items within a passenger's bag, may need a high enough resolution to identify objects within a piece of luggage for it to be admissible as evidence in a court of law. Infrared lighting can also be used with monochrome cctv cameras.</p>
<p>A basic application of this is the monitoring of passenger traffic jetway—if persons exiting an aircraft reverse course, the camera monitoring that jetway will see the change in course and the object tracking software can decide” to notify an operator in the Security Operations Center. Remote Control: Instead of using the keypad to deactivate your alarm, some systems come with a remote control.</p>
