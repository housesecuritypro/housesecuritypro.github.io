<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>

Deliver greater insight in smart cities, factories or environmental applications with real time high-definition video and AI-driven analytics. Big investments by the likes of Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have made home security cameras more prominent.</p>
<p>Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>

<p>There are two main types of connections for CCTV cameras: a fixed cable or a wireless connection. Video surveillance (CCTV, body cameras, aerial surveillance) systems create a number of unique storage challenges.

<p>Though the police claim the cameras are a blessing, residents and experts have voiced concerns about privacy. We've tried out a number of smart home-security systems to see how easy they are to set up and use, and asked a security expert to assess how likely they are to deter an intruder.

In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage and alarm means responsive to said energy.</p>
<p>Nest's parent company is Google and they offer 100% DIY wireless equipment, except for the Guard hub which has to be placed on a flat surface by the door you use most often. There is a wide range of explosion proof digital cameras system available in the market, and you might get confused about the best purchase. But, like Vivint, ADT comes professionally installed and its monitoring centers are super reliable.</p>
