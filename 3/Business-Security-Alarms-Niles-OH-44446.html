<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex.

Even though 1080p is generally the standard resolution for cameras we've tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensors.</p>
<p>Brinks supplies motion sensors and door sensors, as well as live video cameras, and connections between the devices are all encrypted for security reasons.
