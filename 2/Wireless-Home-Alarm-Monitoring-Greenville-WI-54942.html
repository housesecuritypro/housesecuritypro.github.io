<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>As the crime rate is increasing day by day and burglars are becoming smarter by every passing day, the security system for commercial setups likebanks, shops and houses need to be fool proof.

<p>If you want to add extras like cameras or security lighting, the up-front equipment price gets a lot steeper—but there's no company that can beat Ring's $10 a month monitoring fee. Explosion proof cameras can protect your employees from any disaster or accident beforehand, and also provide real-time support. As a bonus, most insurers provide reduced rates when home monitoring systems are installed.</p>

You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want.
