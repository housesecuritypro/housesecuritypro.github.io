<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. This same design is commonly used for Window Sensors, too, where a switch is placed in the window frame and a magnet in the door itself. Video surveillance systems (or CCTV) have evolved significantly in the last several years. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems. In a closed circuit system, when a door or window is shut, the electric circuit is closed.</p>
<p>Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. Because of the home automation feature, you have the option to install the Frontpoint app and gain remote control over your security system, alarm history and visitor activity.</p>
<p>2. If you have ticked record audio in the camera settings and still get no audio, please make sure you have upgraded your security cameras and the NVR to the latest version. These easy-to-use wireless security systems safeguard your home and put loads of smart commands at your fingertips.

Surveillance mandates and best practices are requiring longer retention periods in more public locations and at higher video resolution requirements to support investigations of criminal and terrorist activities.</p>
<p>Aside from receiving video clips whenever motion is detected, an alarm is activated, or a sensor is triggered, it's easy to schedule your surveillance system to automatically record at certain times. To deliver instant home insight, the camera has motion and temperature sensors. Stay mode will turn off all internal motion sensors but keeps door and window sensors active.</p>
