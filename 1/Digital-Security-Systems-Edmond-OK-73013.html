There are more than 25 million operational CCTV cameras globally, and experts believe that around 67% of the burglaries taking place in businesses could be avoided by installing real-time security measures such as CCTV monitoring.</p>

Cameras and doorbells are also easy to install, but you'll have to pair them yourself. The second burglar alarm circuit using arduino is a little advanced one which uses GSM module to send SMS alerts to mobile numbers stored inside the arduino program.</p>
<p>Increasing government and stakeholder funding for developing smart cities and employing city surveillance solutions, rising demand for VSaaS services, ongoing technological advancements in Big Data, IoT, and cloud-based services, and prevalent trends of artificial intelligence and deep learning for video surveillance systems will provide opportunities to players in the video surveillance market during the forecast period.</p>

Houston based LENSEC offers the Perspective VMS video surveillance and video management platform.</p>
<p>ADT Smart Home is the security solution for modern living. He gives you time to sound your burglar-alarm and to get a pistol from under your pillow. When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered. Some energy monitors are used to monitor a single appliance at a time and give you a more detailed look at that particular device.</p>
<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

<p>If you're not ready for a dedicated security system, there are plenty of individual devices available that let you monitor your home from anywhere using your phone or tablet, including indoor and outdoor security cameras, video doorbells, motion sensors, and smart locks. Sadly though, the camera only records video when it detects motion, which means there isn't a continuous recording feature.</p>
<p>Video surveillance software is used to manage data streamed from security cameras, as well as manage the devices. This is evidenced by recent statistics about burglaries and the fact that one occurs every 12 seconds in the US. The most cost-effective way to protect your family, home, and possessions is by installing one of the many burglar alarms currently available on the market.</p>
