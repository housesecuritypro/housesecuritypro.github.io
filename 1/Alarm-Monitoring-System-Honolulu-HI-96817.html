<p>Your basic entry-level DIY system might only support one or two wireless protocols and usually offers a limited selection of add-on components, while more expensive DIY systems will support multiple wireless protocols and are compatible with dozens of add-on components.

<p>In an in-house monitoring system a monitor would be assigned responsibility for a trial being managed outside their usual working group. When a CCTV camera spots something of interest, a recorder ensures you can go back and view it later. The display unit for your CCTV system can range from a simple monochrome screen to an HD color monitor.
