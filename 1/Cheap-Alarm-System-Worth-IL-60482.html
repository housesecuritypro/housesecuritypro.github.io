<p>The best in smart home security systems. It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more widespread feature of American life. Therefore, the wireless control over smart home devices increases the consumers' likelihood of purchasing these devices.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>All Blue by ADT equipment and services are compatible with LifeShield systems.
