<p>The research methodology used to estimate and forecast the video surveillance market begins with capturing data on revenues of the key vendors in the market through secondary research. IP cameras are easier to install than analog cameras because they do not require a separate cable run or power boost to send images over a longer distance. This can really depend on how large the area you want to monitor is. The average home might need multiple cameras to cover the whole thing which could quickly add up to hundreds of pounds.</p>

<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
<p>Since the systems compared here are all installed by the company or another professional installer, all you need to do is open the door to let them in and pay the bill. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. The highest resolution you can get is 700TVL but many mainstream cameras range between 300-550TVL.</p>

If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation.
