<p>If you're not ready for a dedicated security system, there are plenty of individual devices available that let you monitor your home from anywhere using your phone or tablet, including indoor and outdoor security cameras, video doorbells, motion sensors, and smart locks. Sadly though, the camera only records video when it detects motion, which means there isn't a continuous recording feature.</p>
<p>Allowing this data to do far more for businesses than security alone. D) All burglar alarm systems have the same rate of mistaking an animal for a burglar.
