<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Many cheap security systems have extra features too. Monitoring services are performed by a third party monitoring service with an 30-second average response time.

<p>Nest also offers professional monitoring through Brinks home security for $29 per month, which provides additional security by continuing to monitor even if you lose internet or power.
