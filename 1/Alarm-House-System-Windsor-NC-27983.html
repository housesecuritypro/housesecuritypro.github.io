<p>Many ADT installation packages roll together equipment fees with professional installation. Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for an easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reliable because they aren't subject to interference.</p>
<p>If you have a large home or property that needs comprehensive coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras. You'll also want the option to self-monitor your system using a mobile app for smartphone controls. However, larger systems involving multiple sensors will invariably have a separate control unit. When comparing prices for home security, include any expenses for equipment, installation, activation and monitoring.</p>
