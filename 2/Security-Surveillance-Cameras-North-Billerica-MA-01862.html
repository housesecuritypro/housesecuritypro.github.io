There are still a handful of security companies such as ADT, Slomin's, and Vivint, that will send a consultant out to your house to configure a system specifically tailored to your home and then send a team of professionals to install everything, but more and more companies are offering do-it-yourself (DIY) home security solutions.</p>
<p>Remote Video Surveillance Systems Consist of Intelligent IP Camera Systems, Remote Communications, and Remote Power Systems.
