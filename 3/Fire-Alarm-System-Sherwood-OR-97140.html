This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage.</p>

Use it to check out the alarm company with the appropriate authorities: your state Attorney General , local consumer protection agency , Better Business Bureau , and state licensing officials If the salesperson is reluctant to give you this information, consider it a red flag and find another company to consider.</p>
<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
