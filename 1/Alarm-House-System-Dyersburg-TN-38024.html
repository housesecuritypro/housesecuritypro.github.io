<p>At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed. Home Value Monitoring is free, and it only takes a minute to set up. Just enter the address of the property you want to monitor — it's that easy.</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. They do not and cannot monitor security cameras. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted.</p>
