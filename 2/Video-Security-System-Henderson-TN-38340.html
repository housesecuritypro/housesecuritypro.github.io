<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Instead of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based monthly fee, most DIY systems give you the flexibility to chose how and when you monitor your home. Wired home security installation costs start around $100, though some companies offer discount installations for new customers. ADT is the 800-pound gorilla in this market, but with good reason: It makes one of the best home security systems, offering several tiers of systems and services.</p>

Alarm systems installed by Security Instrument offer multiple channels of communication to ensure the fastest, most reliable signal on every emergency call.</p>
