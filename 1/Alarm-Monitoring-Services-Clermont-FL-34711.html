Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings.

Manage your system and smart devices, get intelligent alerts, HD video, and more — so you're always in the know.</p>
<p>Most of the security cameras come with a warranty period. If you want cameras to complement your system, SimpliSafe has one video doorbell and an indoor camera.
