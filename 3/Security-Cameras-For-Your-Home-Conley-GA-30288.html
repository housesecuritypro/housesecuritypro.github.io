<h3>The Advancement of Social Security Technology with Network Security in Conley</h3>
<p>On 17 August, Meity added 13 electronic items, including smart watches and CCTV cameras, to the Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012, which means these will now have to meet standards as notified by the government and companies will not be allowed to import or sell any non-compliant product in the country.</p>
<p>Video image processing ( VIP ) identifies vehicles and their associated traffic flow parameters by analysing imagery supplied from CCTV cameras which normally have a fixed field of view. It has to be noted that this is the number of CCTV cameras available with the police and not the total number of CCTV cameras in the state. Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
<p>It might sound strange but efficiently placing CCTV cameras around your retail space can actually help your customers by allowing you to observe their behaviors more closely. Some systems, like Vivint, let you use the app and control panel for two-way communication, turning it into an intercom system. Boards are the best place to save images and video clips. Despite being one of the smartest security cameras out there, it's also the simplest.</p>
<p>Many of the best burglar alarm companies' monitoring packages also come with a home security mobile app that integrates smart home automation features.

DVRs capture footage from analog cameras in a digital format at the desired resolution and frames per second.</p>
<p>These growing surveillance requirements are in-turn, driving demand to broadly deploy digital video surveillance systems with capabilities that include panoramic, high-definition IP-based cameras, Digital and Network Video Recorders, video management software, indexing applications, facial recognition technology, big data analysis and the storage media to capture and retain it all for as much as 365 days.</p>
<p>The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
