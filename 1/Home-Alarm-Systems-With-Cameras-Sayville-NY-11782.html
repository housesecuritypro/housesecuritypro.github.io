While the company doesn't offer quite as many hours of customer support as other brands, it has a fantastic reputation with lots of vocal, happy customers. Professional monitoring by Abode adds emergency dispatch service and keeps a 90-day log of system activity.</p>
<p>That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. By using the latest technology and our years of expertise in high-speed video capture, we have built a portfolio of products designed for surveillance, physical security, and smart buildings. Many cameras also offer a software zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens).</p>
