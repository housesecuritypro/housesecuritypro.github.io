<p>Many burglar alarm systems are monitored by a professional security company, which is automatically alerted when a burglar (or other disturbance) triggers the alarm.

Additional sensors and surveillance cameras are also available.</p>

If you think you're satisfied with the cloud services, you can go for the optional monthly plans which provide extended cloud storage at a fraction of the cost of traditional home monitoring systems. This started to change in 2010 with the adoption of the H.264 codec and the introduction of the first megapixel cameras, which provided better video resolution for a similar cost.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, typically one to five years. To help you with this important decision, we'll run through all the key features of a home security system, discuss some important choices homeowners must make, and review the major companies offering systems, while first providing some of the main reasons your home may be at risk.</p>
