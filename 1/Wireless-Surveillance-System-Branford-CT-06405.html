<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has quickly become significant security equipment for safety and monitoring purposes. A single four rack unit E-Series chassis can be configured with up to 480TB in capacity, making it 10X more dense with an improvement in rack space efficiency of up to 5X over that of other Digital Video Surveillance offerings.</p>
