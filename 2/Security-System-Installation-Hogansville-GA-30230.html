Select black and white or color: If you are going to use the cameras in an environment where the light conditions are very low, it is recommended to buy a black and white CCTV camera system.</p>
<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an option, you may want to explore hidden cameras , which are cameras that are small and discreet, sometimes fitted into everyday objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.
