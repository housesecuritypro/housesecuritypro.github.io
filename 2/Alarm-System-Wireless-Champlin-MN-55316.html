Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>Environments with more stringent security requirements (for example, schools, public buildings, and airports) rely on 24×7 video streams with higher resolution, and more frames per second to better identify suspicious persons and activity.
