Trend Micro Maximum Security offers protection for your Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS devices, though you get a richer set of features on Windows and Android. Today's round-the-clock operation is continuously challenged to do more with less and are required to increase camera resolutions, provide more points and degrees of view to capture broader areas with the ability to zoom in on people or objects without loss of detail, and deliver sharp picture quality for analytics.</p>
