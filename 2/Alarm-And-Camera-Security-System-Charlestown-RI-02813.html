A boom in wireless security cameras is inspiring a movement in DIY home surveillance. We like the Smart Home Video monitoring plan because it includes security cameras and video monitoring.

<p>As adjuncts to the system the treads of the stairs are sometimes arranged to ring the bell, by completing a circuit when trod on. Door mats are also arranged to close circuits in like manner.

Brinks has pretty standard equipment, but we love its smart monitoring alerts.</p>
