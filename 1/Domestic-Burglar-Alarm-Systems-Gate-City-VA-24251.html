<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
