<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>The Wyze Cam V2's video is on par with that of most of the cameras on our list. Besides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. Network video servers are designed for IP CCTV cameras over WAN or LAN computer networks where each camera has its own unique IP address. Many people don't realize how easy and convenient it can be to control their alarm system from their phone.</p>
