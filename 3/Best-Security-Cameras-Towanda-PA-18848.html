<p>ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, DIY version of the ADT system, and we like its cameras much better than the traditional” ADT versions. The biggest name in home security known for professional installation and monitoring you can trust. CCTV systems have gone beyond the scope of security functions long ago.

The presence of security cameras can serve as a deterrent to would-be thieves, while hidden cameras can protect discretely.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.

You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
