For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>

Alexa Guard integrates with your ADT smart security system. And if you decide you need more protection, it's easy to add Brinks professional monitoring to your Nest system.
