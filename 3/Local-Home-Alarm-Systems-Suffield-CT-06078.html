<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? We would like to appreciate the service provided by EFL for the prompt information given by your Eurovigil Monitoring Station in calling us immediately when there was a burglary attempt at our office thereby preventing any loss. This principle works in the same way with burglar alarms. The cameras and thermal imaging systems need to be connected for real-time uploads 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
