<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. Displays upto 16 cameras (from different locations) on a screen at the same time with 18 zoom, 360° pan and 90 tilt features. Thermography Bullet Cameras feature temperature measurement with a range of -20°C to 550°C (-4°F to 1,022°F) with an accuracy of ±2°C, or ±2%. With monitoring services starting at $8.95 per month, everyone can protect what's most precious to them.</p>
<p>It's also compatible with a number of other smarthome devices, which can be configured so that even when you are away, indoor and outdoor lighting can be programmed to simulate someone at home. This makes it possible to receive notifications regarding anything peculiar your cameras records—such as movement inside your business at 3:00 am—and view it live from anywhere via a computer or smartphone.</p>
<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service.

Stories, photos, GIFs, TV shows, links, quips, dumb jokes, smart jokes, Spotify tracks, mp3s, videos, fashion, art, deep stuff.</p>
