<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Security: There have been plenty of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby monitors, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so be sure to check what steps has each manufacturer taken to eliminate this problem. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit television surveillance systems to automatically record the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.</p>
<p>From something as simple as a smart outlet that lets you turn lights on and off remotely to more sophisticated equipment like a smart doorbell, it all boils down to what makes your life easier and safer.
