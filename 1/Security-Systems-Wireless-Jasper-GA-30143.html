A majority of burglars avoid businesses with video surveillance systems. In this regard, without a stable monitoring system, you cannot ensure a safe workplace for your workers which is necessary, and you need to install explosion proof CCTV cameras to maintain safety at your workplace.</p>
<p>Wireless cameras work by transmitting the camera's video through a radio (RF) transmitter.

You can connect them over Ethernet, with one single cable you can connect each camera to your personal IP, you also have 4 full megapixels and high speed 0over the network, they are compatible with every single Android and iOS device.</p>
