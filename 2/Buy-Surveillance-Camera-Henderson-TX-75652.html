<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Your DVR can handle multiple cameras at once, allowing you to record every room in the house with only one box. While the company doesn't offer quite as many hours of customer support as other brands, it has a fantastic reputation with lots of vocal, happy customers.

<p>Cameras equipped with CCTVs are not only easy to maintain and conspicuous in their absence from the public eye but are also much more cost-effective than many other security solutions. But the company gives you some extra perks if you stick with them, including a lifetime warranty on all equipment as long as you're subscribed to monitoring services.

<p>Alarm Relay provides affordable alarm systems and quality security monitoring. Burglar alarm systems can be inaccurate in two ways: they can fail to detect an intruder when one is present, or they can falsely report the presence of an intruder.

<p>If you have a large home or property that needs comprehensive coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras.
