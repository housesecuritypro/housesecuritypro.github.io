Sadly though, the camera only records video when it detects motion, which means there isn't a continuous recording feature.</p>
<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>When Genetec first introduced the ability to encrypt video data in transit and at rest in 2016, the physical security industry saw it as an important innovation for protecting confidentiality in physical security systems. Another helpful aspect of adding advanced technology to your security system is that key components such as smart doorbells and security cameras can be synched to work together.</p>
