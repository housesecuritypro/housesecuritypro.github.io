<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest.

He says that changing CCTV cameras from passive into active observers could have a huge chilling effect on civil society.</p>
