<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Outdoor security cameras can present more of a challenge, especially if the home's exterior has limited power sources, if you don't have many tools or if you are concerned about affecting your home's appearance. ADT Go is an app that helps provide peace of mind and reliable ADT emergency monitoring wherever you may go. Simply hold down the SOS button during an emergency and ADT will be notified and will alert emergency responders if you're not okay.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given. Weather-ready wired networks let you scatter a combination of dome, turret or bullet cameras around your home-or even multiple properties-to ensure total coverage. Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>

<p>Other companies, like SimpliSafe and ADT, also offer some type of camera. Landline, broadband, and cellular monitoring are different ways your home security system can be connected to the monitoring center. Another object of the invention is to prol vide a burglar alarm system equi ped with suitable light-sensitive devices, e ectrically connected so that any one obstructingralysf t e of light falling upon selected parts system, will involuntarily cause the system 9 to operate.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>

Municipal fees for alarm permits: Some cities charge a yearly permit fee, usually $30 to $50, for local police to respond to emergency calls triggered by monitored home security systems.</p>
<p>A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera , which converted moving images to digital data. This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home components in your house. For instance, there are extremely small surveillance cameras that are used for spying (Nanny Cams), night viewing, are vandal resistant, and that are specifically made for indoor or outdoor uses.</p>
