<p>But a wireless security camera system may probably be one of the most beneficial of all components for your house. In this article, we'll take a look at 10 different types of security cameras and what they're best suited for.

<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level.

Try to position the two parts of the switch so that they are close together - almost touching - when the window or door is closed, and widely separated when the door or window starts to open.</p>
<p>Ring currently offers doorbell cameras, exterior lighting cameras, and plenty of accessories to complement their smarthome doorbells.

<p>Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
