<p>So you've got a ClickHouse DB, and you're looking for a tool to monitor it. You've come to the right place. Some offer home video surveillance as part of a smart security network to work within existing home automation systems , and sometimes monitored alarm systems can be added as an additional service. Whether you're at the office or away on vacation, our state of the art home security cameras and monitors keep you and your family safe. Whether you need smart home compatibility, extra add-on equipment or a professionally-monitored system - there's a solution just for you.</p>
<p>While the company has an A rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), its overall customer rating is just over 1 star out of 5. If you need help with your system, ADT offers an online knowledge base or you can call anytime for help. If you want more peace of mind that a problem at your home will be dealt with quickly, you could consider a burglar alarm with a monitoring contract - 38% of the people we spoke pay for one of these.</p>

The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service. We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it.
