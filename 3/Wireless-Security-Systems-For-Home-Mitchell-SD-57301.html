<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Our goal at Kisi is to have a seamless security experience; therefore, we understand why organizations want to have a burglar alarm system running in conjunction with the Kisi system. DIY-installed systems like Frontpoint , SimpliSafe , and Ring send you the equipment to set up, saving you some money.
