<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Many cheap security systems have extra features too. Monitoring services are performed by a third party monitoring service with an 30-second average response time. Sensors can detect intruders by a variety of methods, such as monitoring doors and windows for opening, or by monitoring unoccupied interiors for motions, sound, vibration, or other disturbances.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given.
