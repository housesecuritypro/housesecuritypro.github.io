There are two main types of CCTV systems: analog and Internet Protocol (IP). Customize with live video, smoke monitoring, remote thermostat control, automated lighting, and more.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
<p>Most Sensaphone devices offer real-time status reports, so you can check on the house while you're away.

<p>Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road. Without professional monitoring, you'll be responsible for monitoring your own home, usually with a mobile app and activity notifications. Surveillance systems are readily being used by governments for crime prevention and investigation, in intelligence gathering, and to protect people, objects, processes, etc.</p>
<p>While IC Realtime offers cloud-based analytics that can upgrade existing, dumb cameras, other companies are building artificial intelligence directly into their hardware.

<p>At the same time, placing CCTV cameras within such locations not only cuts the risk of having someone physically watch over such dangerous areas, but also allow you to see the place in real-time. It is of note that some garage operators do not locate cameras in parking garages and lots due to the concern that doing so may expose the company to liability unless there is adequate staff to monitor the images.</p>
<p>There's widespread concern that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. It's always wiser to invest in a good quality, small, entry level system that allows you to add more cameras later on, than to rush out and buy an unbranded cheap camera, that could lead to buyer's remorse. Using the garage door controller, manage your garage using the Vivint Smart Home app and receive notifications if your garage door is open or if it failed to close.</p>
