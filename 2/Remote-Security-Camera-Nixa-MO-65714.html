<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>The Traditional tier starts at about $129 for installation and $44.99 a month for monitoring, which includes two entry sensors, one motion sensor, a siren, keypad and remote. As with just about every smart home device out there, many DIY security systems can be armed and disarmed using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Increasing concerns about public safety and security, growing adoption of IP cameras, and rising demand for wireless and spy cameras are the factors driving the growth of the video surveillance market.</p>
<p>Installation of CCTV cameras helps not only to prevent crimes due to visual control but also to charge criminals using the information recorded by video camera.
