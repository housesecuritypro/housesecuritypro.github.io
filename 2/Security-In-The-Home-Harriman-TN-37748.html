<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. From door, window and motion sensors to mobile apps and cameras, we'll build the perfect alarm system for your home.

Set one phone as the Viewer and one as the Camera, and enjoy simple security.</p>
<p>Remote patient management with Home Monitoring offers the opportunity to deliver intelligent, event-driven care that improves clinical outcomes without added patient inconvenience.
