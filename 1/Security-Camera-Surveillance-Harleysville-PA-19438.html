<p>For controlling and output for monitoring. When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately.
