<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. So be it the IP cameras based on modern plug-and-play technology that are extremely easy to install or the traditional Analog HD CCTV, D-Link is well equipped to cater to the needs of residential, SOHO, SME, Banking, Hospitality or any other commercial establishment. Smart organizations are increasingly rejecting slow analogue surveillance systems and embracing transformative new digital approaches.</p>

Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
