<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. Ella can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language queries, letting users search footage to find clips showing specific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, or even individual car makes and models. These Decoders are equipped with powerful capabilities and can manage a flexible display of IP cameras on LCD video walls. When a door or window is shut, the contact of the door or window in the frame is detected by door and window sensors.</p>
<p>While the company has an A rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), its overall customer rating is just over 1 star out of 5.

<p>I can easily access camera footage using my mobile.
