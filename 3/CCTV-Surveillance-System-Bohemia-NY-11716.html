<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Security Camera Surveillance: You can choose to add a video camera and monitor to your system so you can catch thieves in the act if they do choose to break into your home. For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. The other features that attract toward this security camera are Weatherproof, Night Vision, Multiple Alarms, Auto Focus, and Tamper Resistant.</p>
<p>That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. By using the latest technology and our years of expertise in high-speed video capture, we have built a portfolio of products designed for surveillance, physical security, and smart buildings. Many cameras also offer a software zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens).</p>
<p>Prevention is always better, so dummy alarm boxes and outdoor security cameras and lights are also great options. Nest uses the same monitoring centers as Brinks, but offers the monitoring service at a lower monthly cost. In multiple camera systems the quad and multiplexers permit multicamera displays on one monitor. Unlike conventional cameras that can only serve the monitoring purpose, a PIR camera, by virtue of the built-in PIR sensor, detects passive infrared radiation emitted from heat sources.</p>
