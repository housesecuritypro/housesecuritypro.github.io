<p>Alarm systems can alert homeowners to the arrival of strangers on their doorstep, and let homeowners remotely keep an eye on their front door for packages and deliveries. DDN storage platforms deliver both the scalable bandwidth necessary to capture and store hundreds to thousands of HD camera streams, and also the massive capacity to manage multiple petabyte environments with the fewest systems and the least floor space and power requirements.</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
