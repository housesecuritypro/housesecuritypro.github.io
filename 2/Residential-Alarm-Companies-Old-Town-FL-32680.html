Active illumination of a scene with infrared light and special infrared detection equipment will sometimes be required for nighttime CCTV operation. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.</p>
<p>Many top security system companies may also offer environmental sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors for fire and flood detection, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors to monitor indoor air quality in real time. Alarm means for producing an alarm when said burglar alarm is armed and more than a predetermined current is drawn from said battery.</p>
