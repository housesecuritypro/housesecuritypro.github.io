<p>The light source I is arranged to project a beam 4 of either visible or invisible light in such a manner that a barrier exists before the door or window 5. If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>

CCTV cameras can also cover a wide area in addition to focusing on a particular spot. Depending on the manufacturer, your home security camera will store different amounts of footage for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do.
