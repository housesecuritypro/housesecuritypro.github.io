Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience.

CCTV cameras in use at a baggage screening checkpoint, where the purpose of the camera is to deter theft of items within a passenger's bag, may need a high enough resolution to identify objects within a piece of luggage for it to be admissible as evidence in a court of law.

<p>These growing surveillance requirements are in-turn, driving demand to broadly deploy digital video surveillance systems with capabilities that include panoramic, high-definition IP-based cameras, Digital and Network Video Recorders, video management software, indexing applications, facial recognition technology, big data analysis and the storage media to capture and retain it all for as much as 365 days.</p>
