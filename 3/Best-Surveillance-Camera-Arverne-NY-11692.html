<p>While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by authoritarian governments against political dissidents In these cases, the person under house arrest often does not have access to any means of communication with people outside of the home; if electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored.</p>
<p>Network cameras are ideal for both domestic and commercial purposes because you can see what's going on whilst away from the property. A few years ago, you'd need to budget thousands in order to create a video monitoring, web-connected, home security system, but today you can install a few affordable wireless sensors, a connected motion-sensing camera and enjoy 24-7 home monitoring, with alerts sent direct to your phone from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>By leveraging existing video surveillance infrastructure, video analytics are a highly cost-effective means to augment security with new detection capabilities, reduce staffing requirements by directing attention to key events, automate access control and other facility functions, and collect data on customer behavior. After the September 11th attacks, US policymakers and security and intelligence services are increasingly turning toward video surveillance technology as the answer to terrorist threats and the public's demand for security.</p>

<p>Popular monitoring solutions include ADT, SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, etc. When the magnetic connection is broken by opening a door or window that is protected, the alarm is triggered. I used a monitoring service from CardioNet for several years until my insurance decided they wouldn't cover it any more. The largest proportion, 65%, have a deadlocks on doors, 57% have outdoor security lighting and 45% a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
