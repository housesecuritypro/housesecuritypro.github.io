<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Security: There have been plenty of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby monitors, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so be sure to check what steps has each manufacturer taken to eliminate this problem. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit television surveillance systems to automatically record the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.</p>
<p>Environments with more stringent security requirements (for example, schools, public buildings, and airports) rely on 24Ã—7 video streams with higher resolution, and more frames per second to better identify suspicious persons and activity. Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>
<p>All Blue by ADT equipment and services are compatible with LifeShield systems. Some DIY systems are self-monitored, which means you'll receive alerts when devices are triggered, but it's up to you to contact the local authorities if there's a break-in or a fire. Our data management solutions excel in both, helping you to reduce storage costs and network strain without compromising the video quality you rely on for effective security.</p>

<p>Blue by ADT has a collection of cameras that connect to LifeShield security systems wirelessly. The base home system that the company offers includes a decent selection of features, with three entry sensors, one motion sensor and a touch-screen control center for $360.
