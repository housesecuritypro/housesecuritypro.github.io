<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud.

IP security cameras send their signals over a network, allowing greater information transfer than an analog signal sent to a digital video recorder (DVR).
