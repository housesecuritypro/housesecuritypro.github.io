<p>Video image processing ( VIP ) identifies vehicles and their associated traffic flow parameters by analysing imagery supplied from CCTV cameras which normally have a fixed field of view. It has to be noted that this is the number of CCTV cameras available with the police and not the total number of CCTV cameras in the state. Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. They do not and cannot monitor security cameras. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted.</p>
<p>Most home security providers do offer common smart security tools such as smart thermostats, smart lights, and smart locks. The internet of things (IoT) is also playing a major role in CCTV camera related advancements and is contributing to the growth of the global CCTV camera market.
