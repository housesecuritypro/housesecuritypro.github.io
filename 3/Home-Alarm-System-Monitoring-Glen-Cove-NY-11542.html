<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. This same design is commonly used for Window Sensors, too, where a switch is placed in the window frame and a magnet in the door itself. Video surveillance systems (or CCTV) have evolved significantly in the last several years. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems. In a closed circuit system, when a door or window is shut, the electric circuit is closed.</p>

<p>PIR sensors are increasingly used to control automated lighting systems to prevent lights being left on. This is another project you may wish to set for your children. Turbo HD Cameras provide easy plug-and-play through coaxial cable, delivering quality images with durability.
