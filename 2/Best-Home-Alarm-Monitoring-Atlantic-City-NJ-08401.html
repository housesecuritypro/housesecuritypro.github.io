<p>The Vivint Smart Home system is the best home security system as it's the most sophisticated and customizable systems on offer. While these tools make the monitoring process somewhat more accessible and more visually appealing than executing command line SQL queries as described above, they don't support automated alerting, which is a crucial element of an effective monitoring solution.</p>
