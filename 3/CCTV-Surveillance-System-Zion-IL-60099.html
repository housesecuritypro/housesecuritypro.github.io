<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Most cities and townships require an alarm permit if you subscribe to a monitoring service. Because pet safe‚Äù motion sensors can still false alarm if your dog or cat jumps into the protected area or puts on some weight. To avoid false triggering by sunlight, the photo transistor sensor is placed in the circuit such that it doesn't directly face sunlight.

From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
