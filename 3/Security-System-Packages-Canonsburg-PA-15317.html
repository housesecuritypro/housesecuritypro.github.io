You have CCTV cameras coming with range as long as 25 to 30 metres as well. In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. The amount of digital images captured on a DVR is determined by a few factors including the frames per second recorded, the amount of cameras hooked up to the DVR device, the resolution that the DVR saves the images at, and the video compression used (e.g. MPEG4).</p>
<p>Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. The internet protocol (IP) based structure of the new surveillance systems takes into consideration versatility, adaptability, and digital security. The $39.99 monthly service is for a basic alarm system only, while adding a camera or doorbell adds another $5 a month.</p>
<p>You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed know they're being watched, and you can choose to record video clips or pictures and save them to your smart device on a whim.

The intrusion alarm system provides the information about unauthorized entry or threat through alarms, calls and sending SMS to the building manger, security or owner.</p>
<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party.

Therefore, the wireless control over smart home devices increases the consumers' likelihood of purchasing these devices.</p>
