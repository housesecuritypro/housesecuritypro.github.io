<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>
<p>The display lets you communicate with a professional monitoring service when an alarm is triggered and view video from any of the installed security cameras. BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring is also the only remote monitoring system to be approved by the FDA for early detection and as a replacement for device interrogation during in office follow ups. Professional monitoring is not available on this system.</p>

A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
