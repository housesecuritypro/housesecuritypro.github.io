<p>The cameras are pretty basic and bulky compared to other offerings out there at the same (or lower) pricepoint. According to a survey of convicted burglars , 60% were deterred by the sight of a burglar alarm system, with respondents agreeing that they would opt for a different target should they find their initial one visibly fitted with alarms.
