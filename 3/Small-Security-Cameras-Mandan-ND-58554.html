AxxonSoft's intelligent VMS software powered by Huawei's outstanding computing solutions maximizes public and business security. If something triggers your alarm, you can check your cameras to see what set it off.

<p>Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>

These cctv cameras are generally connected directly to a computer or a computer network and are accessed by software to enable the live viewing, recording and playback of the video images.</p>

Several systems offer a keyfob remote control that users can carry and utilize to trigger the system with just a tap of a switch. Even though 1080p is generally the standard resolution for cameras we've tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensors.</p>
