The Network IP cameras use internet protocol for its functioning. OneTouch House's alarm monitoring and security services simplify the way you protect your home and business.</p>
<p>For controlling and output for monitoring. When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>Traditional home security devices like burglar alarms, glass break detectors, and outdoor cameras are helpful if you're worried about issues like intrusion, theft, or vandalism. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks , you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process.
