Sonitrol Western Canada can provide CCTV video surveillance support for interior and exterior video surveillance solutions that range in size from centrally monitored, total corporate systems (fully-networked with dedicated fibre optic backbones) to PC-controlled, IP-based, stand-alone remote access verifiers.
