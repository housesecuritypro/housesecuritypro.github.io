<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Start with detailed description of your security and business requirements and a reliable technology partner that will integrate and deploy the system on your behalf and the sky is the limit. The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal. CCTV cameras also have the potential of creating unintended effects, good and bad.</p>
