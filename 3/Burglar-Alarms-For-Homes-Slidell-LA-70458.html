A fully programmable environmental monitoring system, the Sensaphone 800 allows both local and remote monitoring and control of your home or small business.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation.
