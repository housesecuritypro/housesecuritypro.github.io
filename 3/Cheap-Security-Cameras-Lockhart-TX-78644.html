<p>If you have your security system professionally installed, you will need to be able to take time off work or arrange for someone to be at your home while the system is being installed which could take a few hours or more. Nest Secure comes with DIY and professional installation options, and the system is controlled through the Nest app. If you want to keep it DIY but add more home automation, Abode , Ring Alarm , or Nest Secure will work better for you.</p>
