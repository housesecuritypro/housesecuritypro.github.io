Eurovigil offers highly advanced and complete security systems, which include Video Door Phones, Intrusion Alarm Systems, Home Automation Systems, CCTV Surveillance, Access Control Systems and CMS (Central Monitoring Station). This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit.</p>
