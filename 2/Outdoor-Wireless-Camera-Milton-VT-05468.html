<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. And sometimes, motion sensors can do the job of several entry sensors. This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>Instead of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based monthly fee, most DIY systems give you the flexibility to chose how and when you monitor your home.

The internet of things (IoT) is also playing a major role in CCTV camera related advancements and is contributing to the growth of the global CCTV camera market.
