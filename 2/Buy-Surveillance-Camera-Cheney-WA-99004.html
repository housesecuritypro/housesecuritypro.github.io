<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.

<p>The police will have to first address such privacy issues before asking the public to install the cameras,” says a member of a residents' association, on the condition of anonymity. Security surveillance systems can be generally isolated into a few components, for example, cameras, interchanges, stockpiling, picture preparing, and administration and back-end.</p>
<p>3 Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours. However, during night time and in poorly lit areas infrared or thermal cameras are used that gives black and white images. Trial monitoring can be built into people's roles so they do not do this full time.</p>
<p>Just as a suggestion and maybe useful tip, if you are actually working with more than one or two cameras, you might want to set up a surveillance spot or hub, the central point or your hole security operation, you for sure will want to keep everything in one place, that will guarantee easy access and a lot of comforts when you are setting up everything.</p>
