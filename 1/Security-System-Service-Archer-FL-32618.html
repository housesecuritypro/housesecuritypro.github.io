<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Blue by ADT offers the best of both worlds—easy DIY home security backed by trustworthy professional monitoring from ADT. Simply closing the door or window, moreover, does not restore the switch loop circuit continuity and does not stop the sound until either the battery becomes exhausted or someone switches off the circuit from battery to sounder. With a few well-placed ADT outdoor security cameras, you'll know.</p>
<p>Whether you manage one location or 1,000, an effective video surveillance system serves as a crime deterrent as well as a key method to capture and document security events on your premises.
