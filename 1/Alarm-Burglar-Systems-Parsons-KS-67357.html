<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. From door, window and motion sensors to mobile apps and cameras, we'll build the perfect alarm system for your home. Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously.</p>
<p>Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. Because of the home automation feature, you have the option to install the Frontpoint app and gain remote control over your security system, alarm history and visitor activity.</p>

<p>With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>

The company provides a dedicated customer service line along with a personal home security portal, where you can log in and ask for help if you need it. However, the main issue most customers encounter with this company is the aggressive sales tactics used by the company's reps.</p>
