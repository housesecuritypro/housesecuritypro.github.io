<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Start with detailed description of your security and business requirements and a reliable technology partner that will integrate and deploy the system on your behalf and the sky is the limit. The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal.

<p>Smart locks, smart thermostats, the ability to remotely turn lights off and on, arm or disarm the system from anywhere, and remote camera access are all modern features that can be integrated into any quality home security system for even more convenience and control. IP (Internet protocol) cameras carry out the same functions as their analog counterparts, but with vastly greater capabilities.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
