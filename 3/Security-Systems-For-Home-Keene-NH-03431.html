<p>Eurovigil Security Solution, considered as India's most advanced electronic security system, is a part of the Eureka Forbes family. You have CCTV cameras coming with range as long as 25 to 30 metres as well. In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. The amount of digital images captured on a DVR is determined by a few factors including the frames per second recorded, the amount of cameras hooked up to the DVR device, the resolution that the DVR saves the images at, and the video compression used (e.g. MPEG4).</p>
<p>Smart door locks add a whole new level of security and convenience to a smart ADT security system, allowing you to easily let people in - or keep them out - remotely. Ensure that your mounting equipment is strong enough to bear the weight of the camera, especially when there are movable parts in cameras that cover a wide area. Set one phone as the Viewer and one as the Camera, and enjoy simple security.</p>
<p>Video security provides both an additional crime deterrent and an easy way to look in on your business throughout the day. Potential customers may find ADT's pricing scheme to be disagreeable: it's hard to find clear information on costs on the company's website, and you won't have an idea of your security system's price until a technician comes to your home and draws up a proposal.</p>
