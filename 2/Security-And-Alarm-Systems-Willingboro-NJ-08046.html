<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. And now that the best systems are affordable, functional, and easy to use, there's really no reason not to find a security system that works for your budget and lifestyle. Installing CCTV cameras can not only serve as a strict deterrent and provide your employees a safer place to work, but also ensure any such reprehensible activities are caught in the act.</p>

Bottom Line: Vivint is a high-end wireless system that offers same day professional installation.</p>
<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service. We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it.
