<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Most cities and townships require an alarm permit if you subscribe to a monitoring service. Because pet safe” motion sensors can still false alarm if your dog or cat jumps into the protected area or puts on some weight.
