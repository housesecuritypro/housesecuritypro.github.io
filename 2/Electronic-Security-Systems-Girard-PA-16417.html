<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. And sometimes, motion sensors can do the job of several entry sensors. This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>This has grown from the American intruder market, where end users want the control panel to not only deter intruders but to also control the whole house, for example switching appliances or the heating on. In the UK market, the security system is still currently seen purely as a means of providing a deterrent. The IR LEDs enable the cameras to capture images in complete darkness.</p>

<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
