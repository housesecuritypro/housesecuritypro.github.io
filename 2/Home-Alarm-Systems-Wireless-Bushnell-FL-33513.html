In recent times, surveillance systems are gaining a lot of popularity. These security systems have helped the police department solved countless cases of theft and other criminal activity. Since IP cameras have a wider field of vision, as well, an IP system can often work with fewer less cameras than an analog system.</p>
<p>If you're not ready for a dedicated security system, there are plenty of individual devices available that let you monitor your home from anywhere using your phone or tablet, including indoor and outdoor security cameras, video doorbells, motion sensors, and smart locks. Sadly though, the camera only records video when it detects motion, which means there isn't a continuous recording feature.</p>
