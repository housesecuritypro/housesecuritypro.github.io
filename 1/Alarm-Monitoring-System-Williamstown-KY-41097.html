Use the ADT mobile app to view your security cameras through your mobile device. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and typically onerous contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage.</p>
<p>Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors.

<p>The Wyze Cam V2's video is on par with that of most of the cameras on our list. Besides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee.
