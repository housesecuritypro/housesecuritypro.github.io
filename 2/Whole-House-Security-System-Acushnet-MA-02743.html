But Atos, EMC and local security providers, such as Chubb in the UK, have come together to deliver the only end-to-end Managed Digital Video Surveillance service spanning consult, design, build and operate. When a door or window is closed, the two parts of the sensor are joined together, creating a security circuit.</p>
