<p>Installation of CCTV cameras helps not only to prevent crimes due to visual control but also to charge criminals using the information recorded by video camera.

Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
