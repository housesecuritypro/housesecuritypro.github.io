This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage.</p>
