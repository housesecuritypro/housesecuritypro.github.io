<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings. Slash the time spent manually looking through backlogs of video footage seeking evidence and cross-checking to build a comprehensive picture. Manage your system and smart devices, get intelligent alerts, HD video, and more — so you're always in the know.</p>
<p>Existing home security customers are usually vocal about unfair fees and equipment durability in burglar alarm reviews. Hello Rupe, we are sorry that you cannot record Reolink cameras to your own web server or cloud since our cameras don't support such network protocols.

<p>Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
