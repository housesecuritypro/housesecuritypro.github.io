<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. That's why we recommend a camera of some kind with your DIY security system. But Atos, EMC and local security providers, such as Chubb in the UK, have come together to deliver the only end-to-end Managed Digital Video Surveillance service spanning consult, design, build and operate. When a door or window is closed, the two parts of the sensor are joined together, creating a security circuit.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system. The home security market offers many plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to deter intruders who trigger a door or window sensor. In areas of cellular communication, the SAT130 can provide high-speed IP communications to IP cameras for streaming video, video and image files.</p>

Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hello doorbell. In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm.</p>
<p>The base unit itself can detect motion and sound, and when its smart sensors are triggered it can record in 1080 HD video. Standard home security equipment: Protect America gets you started with a free, basic equipment package when you sign up for a monitoring plan.

Alternately, battery-operated remote wireless sensors and controls can be installed.</p>
