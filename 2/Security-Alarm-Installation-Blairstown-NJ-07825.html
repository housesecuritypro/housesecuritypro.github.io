<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Outdoor security cameras can present more of a challenge, especially if the home's exterior has limited power sources, if you don't have many tools or if you are concerned about affecting your home's appearance. ADT Go is an app that helps provide peace of mind and reliable ADT emergency monitoring wherever you may go. Simply hold down the SOS button during an emergency and ADT will be notified and will alert emergency responders if you're not okay.</p>
<p>We really enjoyed using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier package comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure. Such a device is similar in functionality to a PC with a capture card and appropriate video recording software Unlike PCs, most DVRs designed for CCTV purposes are embedded devices that require less maintenance and simpler setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.</p>

IP cameras are easier to install than analog cameras because they do not require a separate cable run or power boost to send images over a longer distance.
