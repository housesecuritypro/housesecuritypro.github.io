<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Many cheap security systems have extra features too. Monitoring services are performed by a third party monitoring service with an 30-second average response time. Sensors can detect intruders by a variety of methods, such as monitoring doors and windows for opening, or by monitoring unoccupied interiors for motions, sound, vibration, or other disturbances.</p>
<p>Instead of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based monthly fee, most DIY systems give you the flexibility to chose how and when you monitor your home.

The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. All of the systems in this article are installed by professionals, which are good for those who don't have the time, patience, or expertise to install all the requisite sensors and equipment.</p>
<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

Though some burglar alarms are successfully triggered by the unexpected motion caused by break-ins, studies have shown that an audible alarm may not always have the intended effect. In general, the customer reviews regarding the quality of service are positive, which can sometimes be hard to find in the home security business.</p>
