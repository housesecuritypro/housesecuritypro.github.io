<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>The report presents information regarding the key drivers, restraints, and opportunities in the video surveillance market. This means you can integrate it with other smart home features, not least lighting and heating, as required, using voice commands or your mobile app. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system.</p>
