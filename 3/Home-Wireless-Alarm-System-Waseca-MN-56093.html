<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard.
