<p>If you want to keep an eye on what's happening in your home when you're not there, but you don't want to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look. The top security companies offer security suites that integrate a variety of features.

In both cases, though, what these firms are currently offering is just the tip of the iceberg. Growing concern about public safety is prompting wider deployment of video surveillance by government agencies, private organizations, and consumers.

In addition to having the best full-service DIY installation option, Frontpoint is known for the way it takes care of its customers.</p>
