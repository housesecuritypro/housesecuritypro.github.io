<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app. Smart door locks are a core component of any comprehensive home security system.</p>
<p>Should a monitored door or window suddenly be opened, the security circuit is broken and the control panel interprets this as a breach of a secured zone. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection.</p>

When a customer calls East Texas Alarm, they speak with an actual East Texas Alarm employee directly about their monitoring and service needs.
