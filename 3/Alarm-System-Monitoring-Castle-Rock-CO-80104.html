In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The Gold Plan offers security you can rely on plus home automation and energy management features. However, wireless systems are usually more expensive, and you will need batteries for all components, such as the control panel and all sensors.
