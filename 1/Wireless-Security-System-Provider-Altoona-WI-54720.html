<p>With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>
<p>By leveraging existing video surveillance infrastructure, video analytics are a highly cost-effective means to augment security with new detection capabilities, reduce staffing requirements by directing attention to key events, automate access control and other facility functions, and collect data on customer behavior. After the September 11th attacks, US policymakers and security and intelligence services are increasingly turning toward video surveillance technology as the answer to terrorist threats and the public's demand for security.</p>
<p>Let us know if you're thinking about adding a security system, video camera, or anything else to your home to help you stay safe. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. Instead, build your own system from an extensive equipment lineup, which includes intrusion protection, environmental monitoring, security cameras and smart home devices Vivint's alarm panel doubles as a smart home hub, so it's compatible with home automation devices from other manufacturers as well.</p>
