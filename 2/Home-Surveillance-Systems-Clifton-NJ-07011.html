Just like every other business, you should also weigh the pros and cons of installing surveillance systems to monitor your premises, and if you do so, then Flatworld Solutions is the best partner to ensure your business security never skips a beat.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>The majority of security systems come with wireless sensors that can be placed in strategic locations around your home, like on doors or windows and in living rooms and bedrooms. Once all connected together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensor, you will receive an alert on your phone. Pacific Controls offers an innovative, reliable and secure solution - Video Surveillance as a Service to meet the objective of implementing video surveillance solution for inland security.</p>
