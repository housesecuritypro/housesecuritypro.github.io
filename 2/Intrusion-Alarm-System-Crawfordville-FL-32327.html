<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Some cameras will store the video locally and some will store it in the cloud and usually require a cloud subscription to access the recordings.

Manage your system and smart devices, get intelligent alerts, HD video, and more — so you're always in the know.</p>
