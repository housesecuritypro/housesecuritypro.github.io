However, important questions need to be addressed before uncritically accepting the routine surveillance of public spaces, including whether video surveillance is an effective remedy for crime prevention and deterrence and whether it is an appropriate security measure in terms of civil liberties protections. However, as a user, you have to subscribe to the professional monitoring service.</p>
<p>Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. Because of the home automation feature, you have the option to install the Frontpoint app and gain remote control over your security system, alarm history and visitor activity.</p>
