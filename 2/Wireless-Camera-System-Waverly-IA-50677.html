<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. When there is a requirement for recording more than one cctv camera and video switcher can be used, the cameras are connected into the switcher and the switcher will automatically switch the image being fed to the monitor and the video. Your ADT smart security technician can help ensure you're getting the right solution for your needs, and help set up your system so it's ready to go.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>However, combined with the compatible locks, alarms, webcams and sensors, you can create a seriously secure home. It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular.
