<p>Basically two sensors are used, one is Motion Detector and other one Window Sensor. Magnetic switches are the most common sensing devices for sensing opening and closing of doors and windows.

The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.</p>
<p>Start with the basics, then choose the sensors and cameras that best suit your living situation. A multiplexer is a device that takes multiple video images and lays them onto a VHS tape, it uses the properties of the PAL signal to record as many images from multiple cctv cameras every second as possible.
