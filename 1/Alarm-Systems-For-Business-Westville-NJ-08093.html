<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>
<p>Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>

<p>However, optics (lenses and image sensors ), not video resolution, are the components that determine the image quality.

<p>Meanwhile, free DIY systems put you in control, similarly alerting you through your phone and allowing you to call authorities if necessary. Reviewers found that the Nest Secure system was easy to install, with the small sensors easily fitting into corners in hallways and on door frames.

The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger.
