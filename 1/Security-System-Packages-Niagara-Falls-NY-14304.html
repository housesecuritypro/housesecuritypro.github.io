The global video surveillance market was valued at $42.94 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $144.85 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2027.

Window foil is a less sophisticated, mostly outdated detection method that involves gluing a thin strip of conducting foil on the inside of the glass and putting low-power electric current through it. Breaking the glass is practically guaranteed to tear the foil and break the circuit.</p>

In addition to the safes and doorbell cameras, we also have excellent fire alarms to keep your home safe from unforeseen fires.
