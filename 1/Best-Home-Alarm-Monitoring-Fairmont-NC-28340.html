<p>Video surveillance systems and accessories deter theft and vandalism and record offenders. In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems often can use broadband signaling as a method of alarm transmission, and manufacturers are including IP reporting capability directly in their alarm panel products. Frontpoint security systems require a one-time activation fee of up to $199.</p>

<p>Although, there are some security companies who offer same day installation, but those are few and far between.
