<p>Start with the basics, then choose the sensors and cameras that best suit your living situation. A multiplexer is a device that takes multiple video images and lays them onto a VHS tape, it uses the properties of the PAL signal to record as many images from multiple cctv cameras every second as possible. Use it to check out the alarm company with the appropriate authorities: your state Attorney General , local consumer protection agency , Better Business Bureau , and state licensing officials If the salesperson is reluctant to give you this information, consider it a red flag and find another company to consider.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are also useful in detecting elder abuse.

<p>Sometimes that means a human watching live footage, usually from multiple video feeds. If this happens, call your current monitoring company to confirm. But the industry is still dominated by outdated analogue-based surveillance systems that occupy a lion's share of about 68 per cent in the market. Experts studying how the camera systems in Britain are operated have also found that the mostly male (and probably bored) operators frequently use the cameras to voyeuristically spy on women.</p>
