<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>

<p>Some cameras only record when something triggers the alarm, and then those video clips are saved on the cloud or on a local storage device. How security cameras, DVRs and the future of cloud computing can help mitigate risk and provide for a secure enterprise. Once inside your home, however, they may install a new security system and have you sign papers that include a costly contract for the monitoring service.</p>
<p>Cameras and monitors enable you to view events live, and recorders archive footage for later reference. Furthermore, CMOS sensor-based CCTV cameras would register revenue nearly thrice that of the CCD variant. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Otherwise, when the storage space is full, the NVR will start loop recording and you may lose the previous footage.</p>
