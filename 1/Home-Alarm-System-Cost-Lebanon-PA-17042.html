<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Digital Video Recorder (DVR) is used for video monitoring and storage of the recorded videos, and be a part of feature-rich security system. With so many options available, ranging from simple alarm sensors to monitored services with remote access, now is a great time to assess your home's security and find a system that suits your needs.

<p>Several CCTV cameras can be integrated into your smart home, linking up with tech such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Most of the sensors detect opening of a door, window or breakage of glass or movement of human beings. Then, when the light beam is intercepted, the grid voltage is permitted to go to a high negative value, thereby cutting off the plate current and operating the alarm or indicator relay.</p>
<p>Suggestions include rotating personnel every two hours, limit TV monitors to fewer than 10, arrange monitors in a curved configuration in front of the viewer, control the lighting over the console to avoid glare on the monitor screens or tilt the monitors if necessary, place the monitors in an order that permits easy recognition of camera locations, provide a swivel chair that hampers the opportunity for sleeping, and assign tasks to the viewer (e.g., communications and logging).</p>
<p>Its cameras were among the first to go beyond features like motion detectors and night vision to include new AI technology like familiar facial recognition, as well as 4K image sensors.

Several systems offer a keyfob remote control that users can carry and utilize to trigger the system with just a tap of a switch.
