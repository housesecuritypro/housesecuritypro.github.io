<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. In terms of overall video performance, there's no doubt that the Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera is the real MVP. With the free Arlo app, you have complete control of the monitoring system all the time, anywhere you are. Many home security systems today — like Frontpoint, Scout and abode — offer DIY options that require no previous installation experience. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>If an intruder breaks in a house through a door or window, his movements will be detected by a switch which will trigger the burglar alarm.
