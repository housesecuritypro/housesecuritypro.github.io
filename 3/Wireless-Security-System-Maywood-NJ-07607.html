There are still a handful of security companies such as ADT, Slomin's, and Vivint, that will send a consultant out to your house to configure a system specifically tailored to your home and then send a team of professionals to install everything, but more and more companies are offering do-it-yourself (DIY) home security solutions.</p>

<p>3 Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours.

Trial monitoring can be built into people's roles so they do not do this full time.</p>
<p>Security functions are performed in the most efficient way with the help of motion detectors on video cameras and intrusion detection sensors. Home security equipment:: Home8 security packages are more than just a camera or a keypad. You would need to install multiple cameras to view a larger area.
