<p>This signal is also supplied to an input of AND gate 48. Thus, after arming has occurred, any change in the state of discharge comparator 40 is not coupled through AND gate 48 and OR gate 46. This prevents a discharge resulting from an unauthorized entry into the vehicle from resetting arming timer 50. However, an engine start will cause comparator 42 to provide a logic high signal output due to charging of battery 10, thus resetting arming timer 50, and preventing an alarm from being sounded, as described below.</p>

If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
