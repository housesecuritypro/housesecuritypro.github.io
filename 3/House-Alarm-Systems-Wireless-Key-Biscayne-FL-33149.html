Companies like abode and Arlo sell systems that begin recording footage as soon as motion detectors in your home are tripped, sending the video feed or a text alert to your phone while you're out.

It comes with a dedicated mobile app on Android and iOS which you can use to control the cameras.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.
