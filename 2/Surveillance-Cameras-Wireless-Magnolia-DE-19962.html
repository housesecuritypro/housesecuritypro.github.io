<p>There are many advantages that an IP camera CCTV system offers over an analog format. With professional monitoring, if the system senses an intruder, you'll get a notification such as a text message or email, and if you don't respond, the monitoring company will call authorities for you, which is helpful if you're not always available to check your phone.</p>

Installing CCTV cameras can not only serve as a strict deterrent and provide your employees a safer place to work, but also ensure any such reprehensible activities are caught in the act.</p>
