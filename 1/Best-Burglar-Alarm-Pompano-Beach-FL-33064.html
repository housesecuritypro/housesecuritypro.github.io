<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras on the corner of a building. 2Professional monitoring available in 50 U.S. states and Canada (excluding Quebec).

CCTV Digital video recorders have various settings to enable more video information to be recorded at the required times using technology such as video motion detection, this means that the images from the cctv cameras are only recorded when the information of the image changes, for example a person walking in front of the cctv camera.</p>
