Doorbell cameras are great. 6, 7 and 8 illustrate the manner in which the voltages of the outputs of cells 9 and 10 will vary both during normal operation and during interception of the light beam by an intruder or other unannounced person.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
