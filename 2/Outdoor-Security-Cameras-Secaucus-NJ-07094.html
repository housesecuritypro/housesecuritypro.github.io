Smart home security cameras have to be able to identify visitors and send alerts in order keep your home safe when you are away.

Choose from dome cameras, bullet cameras , or motorized pan-tilt-zoom camera systems depending on your security needs.</p>
<p>The appropriate areas for proper placement of cameras can be entrances, hallways, driveways, T- Points, highway intersection points, exits, etc., and in areas where there is a high density of people or vehicles.
