<h4>Best Burglar Alarm Systems For Homes Mulvane 67110</h4>
<p>Motion detection: Assuming you're monitoring your home when it's empty, motion detection is one of the most desirable features in a security camera. When an alarm is triggered, trained professionals take the appropriate action: alerting your emergency contacts, dispatching Guard Response (where available) to verify intrusion alarms, and alerting the appropriate responders - e.g. police, fire dept, ambulance - if an emergency is confirmed.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
