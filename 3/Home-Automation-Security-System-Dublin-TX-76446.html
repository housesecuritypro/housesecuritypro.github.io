<p>To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically alert the control panel, setting off the alarm. These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things has made it easier than ever to set up a smart home in which you can remotely control your door locks, lights, thermostats, vacuums , lawn mowers , and even pet feeders, using your smartphone and an app. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. 29.1% of Americans own a DIY home security product, such as a video doorbell, self-monitored system, or a smart lock.</p>
