When you look at the total value, a professionally monitored home security system is an incredibly cost effective way to protect your family and provide peace of mind.</p>
<p>Some DVRs also allow digital broadcasting of the video signal, thus acting like a network camera. We consider this the best method used today for your alarm system monitoring. A physical attack could be accompanied by a cyber attack on the video surveillance infrastructure, as a means of compromising the ability of the latter to detect the physical security incident.</p>
