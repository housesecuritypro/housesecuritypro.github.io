<p>As for the wearable cameras, it's hard to spot them if someone is recording you. Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino to develop a system for monitoring and controlling your home. Use the ADT mobile app to view your security cameras through your mobile device. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and typically onerous contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage.</p>

We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do.
