Requires Alexa device, enrollment in Amazon Alexa app, ADT interactive services, and Internet connectivity. We are interested in market studies and forecasts about the IP video surveillance market, especially IP cameras above 1MP, defined by region, type of camera and competitor.

Furthermore, CMOS sensor-based CCTV cameras would register revenue nearly thrice that of the CCD variant.
