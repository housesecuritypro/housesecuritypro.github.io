<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Most cities and townships require an alarm permit if you subscribe to a monitoring service. Because pet safe‚Äù motion sensors can still false alarm if your dog or cat jumps into the protected area or puts on some weight. To avoid false triggering by sunlight, the photo transistor sensor is placed in the circuit such that it doesn't directly face sunlight. Addictionally, built-in Wi-Fi modules provide live viewing on your mobile device, giving you what you need to establish moment-by-moment security in a wide range of scenarios, such as law enforcement, personal observation, hunting, and so much more.</p>
