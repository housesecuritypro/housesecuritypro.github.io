<p>Your basic entry-level DIY system might only support one or two wireless protocols and usually offers a limited selection of add-on components, while more expensive DIY systems will support multiple wireless protocols and are compatible with dozens of add-on components. Expect most wireless CCTV cameras to send data to a range of about 200 feet. The cameras start recording events when the system detects movement.</p>
