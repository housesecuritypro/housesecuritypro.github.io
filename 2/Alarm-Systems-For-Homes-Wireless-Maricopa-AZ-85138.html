<h3>Modern Security and Surveillance Systems For Your Home in Maricopa</h3>
<p>Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>Home security has never been as easy and effortless as it is with the ADT Control app. Also, CCTV camera technology is steadily getting better, allowing you to benefit from high-tech wireless systems which are replacing older fiber optic wiring. The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future.</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. They do not and cannot monitor security cameras. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted.</p>
<p>Traditional home security devices like burglar alarms, glass break detectors, and outdoor cameras are helpful if you're worried about issues like intrusion, theft, or vandalism. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks , you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors. If you require more than a week's worth of video storage, you can subscribe to a 30-day plan and not have to worry about losing important footage before you've had a chance to review it and download it.</p>
