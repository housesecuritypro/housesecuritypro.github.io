As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest.

He says that changing CCTV cameras from passive into active observers could have a huge chilling effect on civil society.</p>
<p>Most of the security cameras come with a warranty period. If you want cameras to complement your system, SimpliSafe has one video doorbell and an indoor camera.
