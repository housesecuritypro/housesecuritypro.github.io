<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. That's why we recommend a camera of some kind with your DIY security system. But Atos, EMC and local security providers, such as Chubb in the UK, have come together to deliver the only end-to-end Managed Digital Video Surveillance service spanning consult, design, build and operate. When a door or window is closed, the two parts of the sensor are joined together, creating a security circuit.</p>
<p>For that reason, security companies offer some of the best deals and sales for home security during this time. In future, the police will be installing cameras with facial recognition feature. Slinex offers a wide range of IP equipment combining the innovation in IP technology which is applied to the intercom systems. Numerous studies show homes without security systems, when compared to those with professionally monitored systems, are up to three times more likely to be burglarized because burglars are opportunistic by nature and are on the hunt for easy targets.</p>
