Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system.

<p>Professional monitoring includes a team of specialists available around-the-clock for emergencies. Everything can be managed directly using a mobile app, a home security panel, and voice controls when using Google Home or Alexa. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees.</p>
