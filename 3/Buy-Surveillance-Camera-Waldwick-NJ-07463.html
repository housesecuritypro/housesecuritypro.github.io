<p>The best in smart home security systems. Home security centers also offer environmental monitoring. The ADT mobile app extends control of your system to your phone. Pricing for DIY security systems varies from company to company and will depend on the size of your home and the number of sensors and add-on components that you order. Big-name cameras like iLuv, Oco, Philips, Axis, Dahua, Hikvision, Milesight—and many others—love Ivideon right out of the box.</p>
<p>These wall-mounted devices now come with modern touchscreens, allowing you to control your home security and automation with the simple swipe of a finger. Run the software that came with your camera to set a password for the camera, and to see the IP address your router has assigned it. Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
