And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has quickly become significant security equipment for safety and monitoring purposes.

The company specializes in 100% wireless systems able to be controlled through the company's mobile app. Cameras that capture 4K (Ultra HD) video are also available, but you'll need a very strong network connection to stream it without experiencing choppiness or lag, and you'll need lots of room to store recorded video, which may result in expensive cloud storage fees.</p>
