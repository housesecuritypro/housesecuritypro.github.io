This same design is commonly used for Window Sensors, too, where a switch is placed in the window frame and a magnet in the door itself. Video surveillance systems (or CCTV) have evolved significantly in the last several years. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems.

According to a survey of convicted burglars , 60% were deterred by the sight of a burglar alarm system, with respondents agreeing that they would opt for a different target should they find their initial one visibly fitted with alarms. Wired home security systems trigger a burglar alarm when a door or window is opened.</p>
