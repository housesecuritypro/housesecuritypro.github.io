<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want.
