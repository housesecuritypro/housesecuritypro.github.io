These cctv cameras are generally connected directly to a computer or a computer network and are accessed by software to enable the live viewing, recording and playback of the video images.</p>
<p>Megapixel cameras are so named because the images produced by these devices consist of millions of pixels. In broad terms, advanced video-based surveillance could be described as an intelligent video processing technique designed to assist security personnel's by providing reliable real-time alerts and to support efficient video analysis for forensic investigations.</p>
<p>For most home systems, 1080p resolution, also called Full HD or FHD, is sufficient, but you can also pay more for 2K or 4K cameras, which have, respectively, two or four times as much resolution. The camera doesn't require extra sensors and you only have to download the dedicated app to be able to monitor your home around-the-clock, from anywhere.

<p>ADT launched a DIY security system in late January with the Blue Outdoor Camera , the Blue Indoor Camera , and the Blue Doorbell Camera Each product can be used individually or as part of the Blue by ADT security system, which is scheduled to launch this summer. The alarm will instead be triggered when the door or window is closed. They aren't weatherproof, and you might want indoor or outdoor cameras with more advanced functions.</p>
