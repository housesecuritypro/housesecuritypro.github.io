<p>Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording. It lets you arm and disarm your home security system, control smart devices and check in on your home - from virtually anywhere. Turn off lights, lock doors and arm your security system with a single phrase or control panel touchscreen tap.
