<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.

Sadly though, the camera only records video when it detects motion, which means there isn't a continuous recording feature.</p>
