<p>The Vijayawada City police launched app-based Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) to avoid house breakings. This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage.</p>
<p>You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Video transmission is the means of getting the video signal from the camera to the recording or monitoring device. This kit also includes a separate keypad, contact sensor for doors or windows, motion detector, and a Z-Wave range extender so that you have the flexibility to place the base station as far from the other sensors as necessary. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equal.</p>
