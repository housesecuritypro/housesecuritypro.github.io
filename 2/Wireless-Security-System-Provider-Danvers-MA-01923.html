Hi, Daniel, both Reolink battery-powered security cameras and plugged-in type security cameras will keep recording if there is constant activity in the monitoring area.</p>
<p>This has grown from the American intruder market, where end users want the control panel to not only deter intruders but to also control the whole house, for example switching appliances or the heating on. In the UK market, the security system is still currently seen purely as a means of providing a deterrent. The IR LEDs enable the cameras to capture images in complete darkness.</p>

In some cases, you may have to purchase any security cameras separately. This system provides real-time recording for all cameras.
