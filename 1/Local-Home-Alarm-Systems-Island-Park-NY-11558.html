<p>Eurovigil Security Solution, considered as India's most advanced electronic security system, is a part of the Eureka Forbes family. Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>

<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again.</p>
