<h4>Security Systems And Monitoring Sharon Hill 19079</h4>
<p>Home alarm systems not only protect homes from potential thieves, they also protect family members from violent intruders, they can allow parents to prevent children from using potentially unsafe appliances when home alone, and can alert homeowners to fire, smoke, and the presence of dangerous carbon monoxide. The public is paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over.</p>
<p>They record video at a resolution of up to 1080p, keeping vital metadata such as date, time, GPS location, device number and user details for the purpose of providing evidence. Their equipment is filled with next-level features including custom motion zones and facial recognition making them the best provider for DIY smart home security. Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.</p>
<p>The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras. According to a crime study by the government , 75% of surveyed households that had not been burgled were fitted with security systems like burglar alarms, whereas two thirds of houses that were burgled had no security measures.</p>
