When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.</p>
<p>For controlling and output for monitoring. When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
